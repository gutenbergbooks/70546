<span class="sc">cting</span> on the suggestion of numerous friends
and subscribers I have determined to devote
the Fourth Volume of my Collection to
Parodies of <cite>Popular Songs and Ballads</cite>, which
are probably the most amusing and witty of
all Parodies.</p>

<p>The Songs of Sheridan, Henry Carey, Dibdin, Thomas
Haynes Bayly, Samuel Lover, Eliza Cook, Charles Mackay,
Henry Russell, the Hon. Mrs. Norton, Lady Dufferin, Barry
Cornwall, and W. S. Gilbert, have been frequently parodied,
as well as separate songs, written by the minor poets, such as
Rule Britannia; The Roast Beef of Old England; The
Bay of Biscay; The British Grenadiers; The Vicar of
Bray; The Fine Old English Gentleman; Home, Sweet
Home; The Mistletoe Bough; The Ivy Green; In the
Gloaming; My Queen; The Message; The Lost Chord;
Some Day; Far, far away, etc.</p>

<p>Parodies of many of the best songs written by the
earlier poets, such as Sir John Suckling, Sir Charles
Sedley, Ben Jonson, Herrick, George Wither, Edmund
Waller, and Richard Lovelace, will also be included.</p>

<p>In the previous volumes the songs of Shakespeare,
Burns, Campbell, Sir Walter Scott, Byron, Moore, and
Alfred Tennyson have already been dealt with in connection
with their other poetical works.</p>

<p>Following this Volume of Songs, there will be another
containing parodies of the poems of Thomas Gray, William
Wordsworth, S. T. Coleridge, William Cowper, Lord
Macaulay, Dante G. Rossetti, Robert Browning,
A. C. Swinburne, and of some of the minor English and
American Poets, Nursery Rhymes, etc.</p>

<p>Another Volume will contain selections from the most
amusing Parodies of the principal prose writers,
Sterne, Dean Swift, Dr. Johnson, Walter Scott, Charles
Dickens, W. M. Thackeray, Lord Macaulay, Thomas
Carlyle, Captain Marryat, Benjamin Disraeli, John Ruskin,
G. P. R. James, Ouida, and Miss Braddon.</p>

<p>The last Volume will give full details, historical, bibliographical,
and anecdotal, of all the principal works in the
English language consisting of, or containing, Parodies
and Imitations. A list of all the most important Theatrical
Burlesques will be included, with Authors’ names, the
names of the principal actors and actresses, the date and
place of first performance, and much other information
useful to the dramatic critic or collector.</p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the scheme of the Work
embraces a complete Collection and History of every kind
of Parody and Burlesque, British and American, in a form
admitting of easy reference, and particularly suitable for
Public Entertainments, Readings, and Comic Recitations.
The plan of the Collection is such that any one knowing
the name of the author of any particular work, either
in verse or in prose, or the title of the work
itself, will be at once enabled to find all the best parodies
or imitations of it, together with an enumeration of such
others as are either too long to reprint, or not sufficiently
interesting.</p>

<p>A work devoted to the history of English Parody is not

so frivolous as it may appear at first sight. Thackeray
wrote many parodies, so did Dickens, Sheridan, Fielding,
and Dryden, yet, strange to say, no attempt has yet been
made to classify and collect them. A few short occasional
articles have appeared in the magazines, but these are of
little value for purposes of reference.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the object of a Parody is very seldom
to ridicule its original, more often, on the contrary, it does
it honour, if only by taking it as worthy of imitation, or
burlesque. Poets are parodied in proportion to their
popularity, as was pointed out in an interesting article
which appeared in <cite>The Daily News</cite> (London), October
16th, 1886, from which I venture to quote the following
paragraphs:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why should there be no parodies? The world has
come to a pretty pass of virtue if we are to denounce them
as a ‘debasing of the moral currency.’ Parody has two
values. It is an admirably effective form of criticism; and
it is often a harmless and legitimate source of amusement.
Parody is valuable as criticism, because it is a placing in a
bright light of the faults (exaggerated) of a work of art.
Clearly some forms of art defy this mode of treatment. No
fun could be got out of a parody of ‘Adam Bede.’ No
legitimate fun can be got out of an honest parody of
‘Hamlet.’ Any fun that is got must be lugged in from
without, in the shape of comic songs and music, and antics
in general. But a great deal of mirth may be got out of a
parody of the ‘Corsican Brothers,’ especially when the
mannerisms of the actors are well hit off. To ridicule
mannerisms by slightly exaggerating them is one of the
chief functions of parody. Probably any artist might
learn more from a good, and not ill-natured, parody of
himself than from any other form of criticism. Parody is
sometimes so amusing that even the victims must laugh,
and it is always more or less of a compliment. Nobody
parodies an actor, or a novel, or a poem, or a picture that
has not artistic qualities and a considerable share of
success.”</p>

<p>“As to literary parody, that seldom gives offence. The
vast flock of ravens which follow Edgar Poe’s are the bird’s
courtiers, not his enemies. No man can parody with any
effect, a poem which has not striking and original features.
‘Excelsior’ and the ‘Psalm of Life’ are examples: each of
them has scores of parodies. Miss Fanshawe’s parody of
Wordsworth is an astonishing example of skill in catching
a measure only marked by a strained effort at simplicity.
Perhaps this is the very best parody in the English language;
better even than any in the ‘Rejected Addresses.’
There, too, the Wordsworth, Scott, and Byron are admirable,
and Scott was justly pleased with the success of his
imitator. Whether William Wordsworth was pleased is
not so certain. But authors are not so touchy as actors,
as the ancients knew, or they would not have feigned that
Homer was his own parodist in the ‘Battle of the Frogs
and Mice.’ Greek parody probably reached its height in
Aristophanes, but there is not much fun in jokes that we
have to elucidate with a dictionary and German notes.
Poets are parodied in proportion to their popularity; if a
<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a><span class="pageno">2</span>
bard wishes to know his exact standing in popular repute,
let him ask himself ‘Am I parodied, and how much?’
Lord Tennyson is parodied far and wide, but who ever tries
to parody Shelley? Mr. Swinburne’s ’Dolores’ is the
parent of an innumerable flock of parodies. Yes; she is
mother of parodies painful, by many a wandering pen; but
she frowns on them, dark and disdainful, the mirth and
the mockings of men! They alliterate boldly and blindly,
but none to her music attain; and she turns from them,
cold and unkindly, Our Lady of Pain. Mr. Browning also
has been well beparodied, and a shot or two has been taken
at Mr. William Morris; but the other contemporary poets
have missed the crown, thorny yet desirable, of Parody.”</p>

<p>The classification of the Parodies of Songs presents
some difficulties, but the following arrangement will be
adopted as far as possible; Popular sentimental and
amatory songs; National and Patriotic (English, Irish,
Welsh and Scotch); Naval and Military; Sporting, Convivial,
Social and Humorous Songs.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Oh! a dainty plant is the Ivy green,</div>
<div class="i3">That creepeth o’er ruins old!</div>
<div class="i1">Of right choice food are his meals, I ween,</div>
<div class="i3">In his cell so lone and cold.</div>
<div class="i1">The walls must be crumbled, the stones decayed,</div>
<div class="i3">To pleasure his dainty whim;</div>
<div class="i1">And the mouldering dust that years have made,</div>
<div class="i3">Is a merry meal for him.</div>
<div class="i5">Creeping where no life is seen,</div>
<div class="i5">A rare old plant is the Ivy green.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Fast he stealeth on, though he wears no wings,</div>
<div class="i3">And a staunch old heart has he.</div>
<div class="i1">How closely he twineth, how tight he clings,</div>
<div class="i3">To his friend the huge Oak Tree!</div>
<div class="i1">And slyly he traileth along the ground,</div>
<div class="i3">And his leaves he gently waves,</div>
<div class="i1">And he joyously hugs and crawleth round</div>
<div class="i3">The rich mould of dead men’s graves.</div>
<div class="i5">Creeping where grim death has been,</div>
<div class="i5">A rare old plant is the Ivy green.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Whole ages have fled, and their works decayed,</div>
<div class="i3">And nations have scattered been;</div>
<div class="i1">But the stout old Ivy shall never fade,</div>
<div class="i3">From its hale and hearty green.</div>
<div class="i1">The brave old plant in its lonely days,</div>
<div class="i3">Shall fatten upon the past:</div>
<div class="i1">For the stateliest building man can raise,</div>
<div class="i3">Is the Ivy’s food at last.</div>
<div class="i5">Creeping on, where time has been,</div>

<p>This song first appeared in Chapter <abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> of <cite>The
Pickwick Papers</cite>, which were originally published
in monthly parts, commencing in April, 1836. Ten
years later Dickens started <cite>The Daily News</cite>, the
first number of which was published in London on
January 21, 1846. For many years the paper had
but a struggling existence. Although Dickens only
edited it for a few months, it was well known that
he was interested in its success, so that the author
of the following poem, whilst sneering at <cite>The
Daily News</cite>, had a motive in choosing Dickens’s
poem as the model for his parody.</p>

<div class="i1">But still the old gallows its reign enjoyed:</div>
<div class="i2">And still did “The People” refuse,</div>
<div class="i1">To trust to the rhymes that their friends deployed,</div>

<div class="i1">I’m sitting on the stile, Mary, where we sat side by side,</div>
<div class="i1">On a bright May morning, long ago, when first you were my bride.</div>
<div class="i1">The corn was springing fresh and green, and the lark sang loud and high,</div>
<div class="i1">And the red was on your lip, Mary, and the love-light in your eye.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The place is little changed, Mary, the day is bright as then,</div>
<div class="i1">The lark’s loud song is in my ear, and the corn is green again,</div>
<div class="i1">But I miss the soft clasp of your hand, and your breath warm on my cheek;</div>
<div class="i1">And I still keep listening for the words you never more may speak!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Tis but a step down yonder lane, and the little church stands near,</div>
<div class="i1">The church where we were wed, Mary&mdash;I see the spire from here:</div>
<div class="i1">But the grave-yard lies between, Mary, and my step might break your rest;</div>
<div class="i1">For I’ve laid you, darling, down to sleep, with your baby on your breast.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I’m very lonely now, Mary, for the poor make no new friends;</div>
<div class="i1">But oh, they love the better far, the few Our Father sends!</div>
<div class="i1">And you were all I had, Mary, my blessing and my pride:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">There’s nothing left to care for now, since my poor Mary died!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yours was the brave good heart, Mary, that still kept hoping on,</div>
<div class="i1">When the trust in God had left my soul, and my arm’s young strength was gone:</div>
<div class="i1">There was comfort ever on your lip, and the kind look on your brow;</div>
<div class="i1">I bless you for the same, Mary, though you cannot hear me now.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I thank you for the patient smile, when your heart was like to break,</div>
<div class="i1">When the hunger-pain was gnawing there, and you hid it for my sake!</div>
<div class="i1">I bless you for the pleasant word, when your heart was sad and sore;</div>
<div class="i1">Oh! I am thankful you are gone, Mary, where grief can sting no more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I’m bidding you a long farewell, my Mary, kind and true,</div>

<div class="i1">But I’ll not forget Old Ireland, were it fifty times as fair!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p>A parody of this famous song, entitled <cite>The
Rhino</cite>, appeared in <cite>The Spirit of the Public
Journals</cite>, 1824. It was devoted to insulting
Queen Caroline (the unfortunate wife of George
IV). and her advisers, Lord Brougham and
Alderman Wood, and is quite obsolete now.</p>

<p>In “The Bentley Ballads” (London. Richard
Bentley) is a complete Latin version of <cite>Sally in
our Alley</cite>, entitled <cite>In Saram</cite>. It will be found on
page 406 of the 1862 edition, and is signed

introduced it, with some alterations, in his
<cite>Anna Bolena</cite>, not as his own, but as a representative

<div class="i1">Seated one day on an organ,</div>
<div class="i2">A monkey was ill at ease,</div>
<div class="i1">When his fingers wandered idly,</div>
<div class="i2">In search of the busy fleas.</div>

<div class="i1">It was worse than Salvation’s Sorrow</div>

<div class="i1">I upset my table and tea things,</div>

<div class="i2">Not loth, but unable to speak!</div>
<div class="i1">Then I sought him, alas! all vainly,</div>
<div class="i2">The source of that terrible whine,</div>
<div class="i1">With his cracked and tuneless organ,</div>
<div class="i2">And its melodies undivine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Of course there was no policeman</div>
<div class="i2">To move him away,&mdash;and men</div>

<div class="i2">At your curses, and smile again.</div>
<div class="i1">It may be that I could choke him&mdash;</div>

<div class="i2">To-morrow will come again!</div>

<p>The following parody was written, composed, and sung
with great success by Mr. George Grossmith. It carries the
idea of “The Lost Chord” throughout, yet the air is different,
and the quaint and laughable words form a strong
contrast to the mystical language of the original. The music
is published by J. Bath, Berners Street, London.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Seated one day in her carriage,</div>
<div class="i2">She was lounging well back at her ease,</div>
<div class="i1">And her fingers wandered idly,</div>

<div class="i1">She thought&mdash;as the bunch was missing,</div>
<div class="i2">In her wardrobe it must be,</div>
<div class="i1">So she struck one note of discord,</div>
<div class="i2">Like the sound of a big, big D.</div>
<div class="i2">Like the sound of a big, big D.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">She thought of the sweet little trinkets,</div>
<div class="i2">Whose loss she would sadly mourn,</div>
<div class="i1">Then she thought of her frocks and mantles,</div>
<div class="i2">Some of which she had not yet worn.</div>
<div class="i1">She thought of her precious diamonds,</div>
<div class="i2">She thought of the square plate-chest,</div>
<div class="i1">For at home, in that large old wardrobe,</div>
<div class="i2">She kept everything she possess’d.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then she thought of the sweet love letters,</div>
<div class="i2">Received with many a ruse,</div>
<div class="i1">Then she suddenly thought that the servants</div>
<div class="i2">Those letters would surely peruse.</div>
<div class="i1">Then she thought, with a feeling of horror!</div>
<div class="i2">That the neighbours would surely be shown,</div>
<div class="i1">A piece of black hair neatly plaited,</div>
<div class="i2">Which was not exactly her own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So she dived to the bottom of her carriage,</div>
<div class="i2">Turned the matting all upside down,</div>
<div class="i1">Then she dived beneath the cushions,</div>
<div class="i2">And the lining of her green silk gown.</div>
<div class="i1">She dived in the depths of her mantle,</div>
<div class="i2">And into her muff dived she,</div>
<div class="i1">But only at home in her wardrobe,</div>
<div class="i2">Would be found that lost, lost key!</div>

<p>In <cite>The Complete Angler</cite> Izaak Walton introduced
these two songs, with some modifications, which
are here produced from the First Edition (preserving
the old orthography) of <cite>The Complete Angler</cite>,
published in 1653:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote">“As I left this place, and entered into the next field, a
second pleasure entertained me, ’twas a handsome milk-maid,
that had cast away all care, and sung like a <em>Nightingale</em>; her
voice was good, and the Ditty fitted for it; ’twas that smooth
Song which was made by <em>Kit Marlow</em>, now at least fifty years
ago; and the milk-maid’s mother sung an answer to it,
which was made by <em>Sir Walter Raleigh</em>, in his younger days.
They were old fashioned Poetry, but choicely good, I think
much better than that now in fashion in this critical age:”</p>

<p>The late Mr. Whalley, formerly M.P. for Peterborough,
was a firm believer in the truth of the claim of Arthur Orton
to the Tichborne title and estates. He, and Dr. Edward
Vaughan Kenealy, were the most devoted adherents to the
cause of “the unfortunate nobleman.” When Mr. Whalley
rose in the House of Commons, he was generally greeted
with the cry,&mdash;“Sing, Whalley, Sing!”</p>

<span class="sc">he</span> songs of this prolific writer, which
but sixty years ago were exceedingly
popular, are now nearly forgotten,
A few old-fashioned people may be
heard to warble “She wore a wreath of Roses,”
or “I’d be a butterfly,” whilst “Perfection,”
perhaps the best known of Bayly’s dramatic
pieces, is still occasionally played to afford
some graceful actress an opportunity of displaying
her varied attainments. The author of
“Perfection” had to contend with many difficulties
before he could get his piece performed.
It was rejected at Covent Garden Theatre and
several other houses, but was finally accepted
at Drury Lane. With Madame Vestris, as
Kate O’Brien, it achieved a great success, but
several of Bayly’s other dramatic productions
were less fortunate, and he had nothing to
depend upon but the precarious income of a
journalist for his support. His songs, though
exceedingly popular, brought him small pecuniary
returns during his lifetime, but after
his death his widow derived a small sum from
the sale of his collected works. Although but
a poor and struggling author, it suited the editor
of <cite>Fraser’s Magazine</cite> to sneer at this amiable and
harmless versifier, and in volume <abbr title="four">iv.</abbr> of that
magazine these lines will be found in the <cite>Lay
of the Twaddle School</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">And the bard of the boudoir was Thomas Haynes Bayly;</div>
<div class="i1">With my butterflies, buttercups, butter-flowers daily,</div>
<div class="i1">I buttered my bread,&mdash;heigh, for Thomas Haynes Bayly.</div>
<div class="i1">With my songs and my sonnets, the girls I wooed frailly,</div>

<div class="i1">And a miniature picture of Thomas Haynes Bayly;</div>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Song by Sir Robert Peel.</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the length of time that has now
elapsed since the breaking up of the Tory Administration,
there is scarcely a member of it who does not still look back
with a feeling of the most melancholy regret to the days
when he once fingered the public money within the walls of
the Treasury. On Sir Robert Peel the effect that has been
produced is as vivid as it seemed the first hour after his resignation,
and the unhappy baronet is often heard to give
vent to his sensations, after the debate of the night, in the
following exquisitely touching stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Oh no we never finger it,</div>
<div class="i2">Its name we never say,</div>
<div class="i1">My fingers are forbid to grasp</div>

<div class="i1">From Bill to Bill they hurry me,</div>

<div class="i1">And when they win a speech from me,</div>
<div class="i2">They think that I forget.</div>

<div class="i1">’Tis true that I no more behold</div>
<div class="i2">The council where we met,</div>
<div class="i1">I do not see the Treasury,</div>
<div class="i2">But how can I forget?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They tell me Lyndhurst’s happy now,</div>
<div class="i2">The gayest of the gay,</div>
<div class="i1">They hint that he forgets, but pshaw!</div>
<div class="i2">I heed not what they say.</div>
<div class="i1">Perhaps th’ Exchequer brings him in</div>
<div class="i2">A pretty penny yet,</div>
<div class="i1">But if he grasp’d as I have grasp’d,</div>
<div class="i2">He never can forget.</div>

<p>“<span class="sc">I don’t want explanation, I want air</span>”&mdash;<cite>Brougham
on Ventilation, Vide Times</cite>. “<span class="sc">Lord Brougham</span> has expressed
a very natural repugnance to be treated like an
animal, shut up for the purpose of having ventilating
experiments tried upon him. Such, however, is the fate of
all Members of Parliament who are subjected to the horrors
of <span class="sc">Dr. Reid’s</span> process. We can fancy the agonies of the
Ex-Chancellor, imprisoned in an exhausted receiver, like one
of those little figures we have seen ascending and descending
in a glass tube, according as the air was let in upon or
withdrawn from them. <span class="sc">Brougham’s</span> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rencontre</i> with <span class="sc">Reid</span>

<p>When Sir Thomas Brassey lost his seat in the House of
Commons, he was promoted to a peerage for his services to
his party. Some snobbish toadies immediately set to work
to trace a pedigree for the new Baron, and asserted that one
of his ancestors came over with the Duke William from
Normandy. Whereas it was well known that the father of
Sir Thomas was of very poor and humble origin, and made
his money by honorable hard work as a Railway Contractor.
<cite>Truth</cite> represented Sir Thomas, attired in a suit of mail as a
Norman Knight, appearing to his father, who sits smoking a
short pipe, in the loose and easy costume of his early calling,
a “navvy,” or road excavator. The father thus addresses
the newly made Baron:&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="h3head">PARODIES OF LEWIS CARROLL.</h3>

<p>“Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland,” and
“Through the Looking-Glass, and what Alice
found there” have so long been familiar, and are
so universally popular, that their recent production
on the Stage at the Prince of Wales’s Theatre only
causes a feeling of surprise that they have not been
dramatised hitherto.</p>

<p>It is true, that Colonel Lynes, of the Royal Artillery,
selected the subject of “Alice in Wonderland”
for the Soldiers’ pantomime at Woolwich, more
than six months ago, and at his suggestion Mr. J.
Addison wrote a very ingenious play, which was
<a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a><span class="pageno">56</span>
produced in the Theatre of the Royal Artillery
Barracks at Christmas 1886.</p>

<p>But this was far less complete as a representation
of Alice’s adventures, than the Musical Dream
Play, in two acts by H. Savile Clarke, produced
at the Prince of Wales’s Theatre in December,
1886.</p>

<p>All who have read Alice’s Adventures (and
who has not read them?) should see how
admirably they have been realised on the
boards, and recognise in Miss Phœbe Carlo the
charming little heroine of Mr. Carroll’s invention.
Mr. H. Savile Clarke thus introduces
the subject of his play:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">A Nursery Magician took</div>
<div class="i2">All little children by the hand;</div>
<div class="i1">And led them laughing through the book,</div>
<div class="i2">Where Alice walks in Wonderland:</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Ours is the task with Elfin dance</div>
<div class="i2">And song, to give to Childhood’s gaze</div>
<div class="i1">That Wonderland; and should it chance</div>
<div class="i2">To win a smile, be his the praise.</div>

<p>(A <em>Vulture</em> is a rapacious and obscene bird, which destroys
its prey by <em>plucking</em> it limb from limb, with its
powerful beak and talons. A <em>Husbandman</em> is a man in a
low position of life who supports himself by the use of
the <em>plough</em>.&mdash;<cite>Johnson’s Dictionary.</cite>)</p>

<div class="i1">The rain was raining cheerfully,</div>
<div class="i2">As if it had been May,</div>
<div class="i1">The senate-house appeared inside</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The papers they had finished lay</div>
<div class="i2">In piles of blue and white.</div>

<div class="i1">The Vulture and the Husbandman</div>

<div class="i1">Two undergraduates came up,</div>

<div class="i2">Thumbs are not good to eat.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“The time has come,” the Vulture said</div>

<div class="i2">The pair that went before.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I weep for you,” the Vulture said</div>
<div class="i2">“I deeply sympathize;”</div>
<div class="i1">With sobs and tears he gave them all</div>
<div class="i2">D’s of the largest size,</div>
<div class="i1">While at the Husbandman he winked</div>
<div class="i2">One of his streaming eyes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I think,” observed the Husbandman,</div>
<div class="i2">“We’re getting on too quick,</div>
<div class="i1">Are we not putting down the D’s</div>
<div class="i2">A little bit too thick?”</div>
<div class="i1">The Vulture said, with much disgust,</div>
<div class="i2">“Their answers make me sick!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Now, undergraduates,” he cried,</div>
<div class="i2">“Our fun is nearly done,</div>

<p>Many years ago (it was in February, 1844), <cite>Punch</cite> had a
parody entitled “Meet me with Wimbush alone,” alluding to
Wimbush’s omnibus, which then ran from Belgrave Square
to the Bank. It was jocularly reported never to carry more
than one passenger at a time. But the following parody,
from the same source, is not only more modern, but also more
likely to appeal to the present generation, than a satire on a
long forgotten omnibus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i2">Nor again the anchor weigh with yo, heave ho!</div>
<div class="i6">So I smoke my pipe and sing old songs,</div>

<div class="i1">Yes, my name, d’ye see’s Tom Tough, and I’ve seed a sight o’ service</div>
<div class="i2">Where the waves have rolled like mountains and the howling winds have blown,</div>
<div class="i1">And I’ve never shirked my dooty, and to feel what want of nerve is</div>
<div class="i2">Is a thing&mdash;I says it proudly&mdash;as I’ve never, never known.</div>
<div class="i6">No; I’ve tried with my lot to be always content,</div>
<div class="i7">And never gone in for a railer,</div>
<div class="i6">But I’ve taken the things as Dame Fortune has sent,</div>
<div class="i7">Like a honest and brave British sailor!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And I’m not complainin’ now. No! I’d scorn the very notion.</div>
<div class="i2">Though I fear as ’ow Shipowners isn’t quite the best o’ men;</div>
<div class="i1">But you see I’m gettin’ older than when fust I sailed the ocean.</div>
<div class="i2">And there’s reasons for my speakin’ which was not existin’ then.</div>
<div class="i6">For now I’ve a wife and four little ones, too,</div>
<div class="i7">More sober and cautious to make me;</div>
<div class="i6">For it’s Heaven only knows what it is they could do,</div>
<div class="i7">If disaster and death overtake me.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Lor! I’ve been to sea in ships as I knowed was well-nigh rotten;</div>
<div class="i2">I’ve a-sailed with big deck cargoes as was scandalus to see;</div>
<div class="i1">And I’ve run so many risks that I’ve half o’ them forgotten,</div>
<div class="i2">And I never once protested, no, nor grumbled, sir&mdash;not me!</div>
<div class="i6">But, then, as I’ve said, there was only Tom Tough,</div>
<div class="i7">And no one to bother about him;</div>
<div class="i6">And if <em>he</em> comed to grief, why, ’twas certain enough</div>
<div class="i7">That the world could get well on without him.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the matter’s changed entirely since the bonniest o’ lasses,</div>
<div class="i2">Swore she’d ever love me truly; for since then, where’er I roam,</div>
<div class="i1">Why, my heart with fervent longing, that all other thoughts surpasses,</div>
<div class="i2">Keeps a-turning ever constant towards my happy little home,</div>
<div class="i6">For there sits my Polly a-waiting for me,</div>
<div class="i7">Her heart, with the billows, time beating,</div>
<div class="i6">Whilst each of our little ones bend at her knee&mdash;</div>
<div class="i7">A prayer for its father repeating.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes, it is for Polly’s sake, and the bairns, I’ve been attending,</div>
<div class="i2">To all that they’ve been saying of Shipowners and their craft,</div>
<div class="i1">And been brooding o’er those wrongs, sir, which the Board o’ Trade means mending,</div>
<div class="i2">And at which, when I was reckless, why, I only took and laughed.</div>
<div class="i6">So you, please, mustn’t think that Tom Tough is a shirk,</div>
<div class="i7">Nor in anyways flustered or frighted,</div>
<div class="i6">If he should ask you, whilst he sticks to his work,</div>
<div class="i7">To try if those wrongs can’t be righted.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For you see I ain’t no spouter, and I’ve not the gift o’ patter,</div>
<div class="i2">But all the same I knows full well that many things is wrong;</div>
<a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a><span class="pageno">71</span>
<div class="i1">And drownding is for me and mine so serious a matter,</div>
<div class="i2">That if the case is put for us, it can’t be put too strong.</div>
<div class="i6">So whilst I continues my duty to do,</div>
<div class="i7">Until my last trip is completed,</div>
<div class="i6">I hope that the Board will do <em>its</em> dooty, too,</div>
<div class="i7">And see that Tom’s properly treated.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">There’s such talk about insoorance and the likes, I’ve often wonder’d</div>
<div class="i2">If there’s any human feeling in this great and Christian land,</div>
<div class="i1">For all the while they’re chatt’ring, men is drownding by the hunderd,</div>
<div class="i2">Through the acts o’ greedy owners, if I rightly understand.</div>
<div class="i6">Aye, it’s this that is makin’ a coward of the best,</div>
<div class="i7">And turning good hands into railers:</div>
<div class="i6">It’s this that is crushing the pluck and the zest</div>
<div class="i7">From the hearts o’ your brave British sailors.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So it ain’t for no great favour that Tom Tough just now is praying,</div>
<div class="i2">He wants to have fair chances in the struggle, that is all;</div>
<div class="i1">And if Englishmen loves justice, why there’ll be no more delaying</div>
<div class="i2">In list’ning and attending to his very urgent call.</div>
<div class="i6">Or, leastways, if they at my language still sneer,</div>
<div class="i7">And pass my petition unheeding,</div>
<div class="i6">I knows very well they won’t turn a deaf ear</div>
<div class="i7">To my wife and my little ones’ pleading!</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">A Sailor’s Plea for the “Yo, Heave Ho!</span>”</div>
<div class="i1">Yes, my name, d’ye know’s Tom Tough, and I’ve seed a sight o’ service,</div>
<div class="i2">Where the waves roll mountains high, and the stormy winds do blow;</div>
<div class="i1">But my heart’s as true as steel, and right taut my every nerve is,</div>
<div class="i2">As when, in eighteen forty, I first sung out, “Yo, heave ho!”</div>
<div class="i7">No, I’ve never yet been ailing,</div>
<div class="i7">Since the time I went a-sailing;</div>
<div class="i2">An’ though I’ve been around this world some twenty times or so;</div>
<div class="i7">Aye, although I ain’t a stranger,</div>
<div class="i7">To any kind o’ danger,</div>
<div class="i2">Yet I’m ready still to meet ’em with a “Yo, heave ho!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But although I’m able-bodied, and still fit to furl a “topsel,”</div>
<div class="i2">Or to reef a “maintop-gallant” in a stiff nor’-eastern gale:</div>
<div class="i1">Though I’m sober and quick-handed, yet just like a hulk I’m stranded,</div>
<div class="i2">And I cannot get a skipper for to answer to my hail.</div>
<div class="i7">So as no one me engages,</div>
<div class="i7">Why, of course, my bit o’ wages</div>
<div class="i2">I’d saved up for a rainy day is bound to quickly go;</div>
<div class="i7">And my hopes, I own, is sinking,</div>
<div class="i7">For I somehow can’t help thinking</div>
<div class="i2">That I shan’t get the chance again to sing out “Yo, heave ho!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Yes, the times is changed completely since I first sailed on the ocean,</div>
<div class="i2">For then a British ship, you see, was worked by British tars,</div>
<div class="i1">And every British skipper would have scoffed the very notion</div>
<div class="i2">Of having lots of furriners to man the capstan bars.</div>
<div class="i7">But now, I’ll take my davy,</div>
<div class="i7">’Cepting sometimes in the Navy,</div>
<div class="i2">You will not find a British ship in which they do not stow</div>
<div class="i7">Heaps o’ Danes, and Swedes, and Rooshians,</div>
<div class="i7">Greeks, Malays, and Fins, and Prooshians,</div>
<div class="i2">Who couldn’t, for to save their lives sing out a “Yo, heave ho!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Why, the crews I used to ship with were all chaps with bone and muscle,</div>
<div class="i2">And with lots o’ pluck and courage, and with hearts to England true;</div>
<div class="i1">But what some calls “competition” has so changed the whole position,</div>
<div class="i2">That now to serve for sailors any furrin’ scum will do.</div>
<div class="i7">And if a crew you muster,</div>
<div class="i7">P’rhaps of English there’s a cluster,</div>
<div class="i2">But there’s Chinamen and Lascars, and there’s Coolies in a row,</div>
<div class="i7">All a-chattering in their lingo,</div>
<div class="i7">’Till it’s precious hard, by jingo,</div>
<div class="i2">To hear aboard a British ship the good old “Yo, heave ho!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They say I shouldn’t grumble, seeing that which I complain of</div>
<div class="i2">Is all owing, as they tell us, to, “a known commercial cause”;</div>
<div class="i1">But it’s not much consolation to a chap what fears starvation</div>
<div class="i2">To tell him that his suff’ring’s due to “economic laws,”</div>
<div class="i7">With such things I cannot wrestle,</div>
<div class="i7">But I know a British vessel</div>
<div class="i2">Is very, very different to what ’twas years ago;</div>
<div class="i7">Since its crew now as a rule is,</div>
<div class="i7">Three parts furriners and Coolies</div>
<div class="i2">With scarcely British tars enough to give a “Yo, heave ho!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, of course, it may be cheaper, or, at leastways, for the present,</div>
<div class="i2">To ship a lot o’ furrin’ trash, and sack my mates and me;</div>
<div class="i1">But I’m thinking in the future it may turn out most unpleasant,</div>
<div class="i2">And that what’s now the cheapest may the dearest come to be.</div>
<div class="i7">Say, for instance, there was fighting,</div>
<div class="i7">And the time came for uniting</div>
<div class="i2">The Navy with the merchantmen to keep away the foe,</div>
<div class="i7">Do ye think the Greeks and Prooshians,</div>
<div class="i7">And the Chinamen and Rooshians,</div>
<div class="i2">Would be eager for to help you with a “Yo, heave ho”?</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Do ye think they’d care a button what became of our old country,</div>
<div class="i2">Or raise their little fingers to help England rule the seas?</div>
<div class="i1">No, they’d all be in a flurry just to bolt off, hurry-skurry,</div>
<div class="i2">Would your Coolies and your Kroomen and your Arabs and Chinese;</div>
<div class="i7">Whilst the tars on whose assistance</div>
<div class="i7">May depend the land’s existence</div>
<div class="i2">In the day of sore extremity, which it too soon may know,</div>
<div class="i7">Will be found prepared no longer</div>
<div class="i7">England’s Navy to make stronger,</div>
<div class="i2">Or to volunteer for service, with a “Yo, heave ho!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Aye, the new crews may be cheaper, but I’d ask you was it Lascars</div>
<div class="i2">And John Chinamen and such like that first England’s Empire made?</div>
<a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a><span class="pageno">72</span>
<div class="i1">Was it furriner’s devotion sailed her ships o’er every ocean,</div>
<div class="i2">And opened every corner of the world up to her trade?</div>
<div class="i7">For the sake, then, of the story</div>
<div class="i7">Of old England’s naval glory,</div>
<div class="i2">You surely now some justice to our sailors ought to show,</div>
<div class="i7">And let British brain and sinew</div>
<div class="i7">Still on British ships continue,</div>
<div class="i2">Nor let a furrin lingo drown the British “Yo, heave ho!”</div>

<p>[“Oxford, in the long vacation 1839, was enlivened by a
Nuneham Regatta, a conservative festivity, at which Mr.
Maclean (M.P. for Oxford City, and M.A. of Balliol
College) was the presiding genius, as well as the chief payer
of the piper. I am tempted to introduce here a parody on
the famous song of ‘The Gallant Arethusa,’ in honour of the
nine young gentlemen, natives of Oxford, who, as the crew
of the ‘Ariel’ carried off the chief honours of this regatta.”

<p>This parody refers to the rumours of a threatened invasion
of England by the Prince de Joinville, and ridicules the proposals
then made to call out the Militia. There was another
parody of this song in <cite>Punch</cite>, 1849, relating how two
Grenadiers robbed two French National Guards during their
visit to London. The parody, entitled “The Blackguard
Grenadier,” commenced thus:&mdash;</p>

</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>This disgraceful incident created great indignation, and
there was a loud outcry as to the want of proper discipline
amongst the Guards stationed in London. Yet they still
enjoy the undeserved, and exceptional, privileges they then
possessed, and are better fed, clothed, and paid than their
comrades in the Line regiments.</p>

<div class="i1">“’Twas the twenty-third of July, in the sixteen thirty-seven,</div>
<div class="i1">On Sabbath morn from high <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’, the solemn peal was given;</div>
<div class="i1">King Charles had sworn that Scottish men should pray by printed rule:</div>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">When the sand of the lonely desert has covered the plains of strife,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the English fought for the rescue, and the Arab stood for his life;</div>
<div class="i1">When the crash of the battle is over, and healed are our wounds and scars,</div>
<div class="i1">There will live in our island story a Tale of the Tenth Hussars.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They had charged in the grand old fashion with furious shout and swoop,</div>
<div class="i1">With a “Follow me, lads!” from the Colonel, and an answering roar from the troop;</div>
<div class="i1">From the Staff, as the troopers pass’d it, in glory of pride and pluck.</div>
<div class="i1">They heard and they never forgot it, one following shout, “Good luck!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Wounded and worn he sat there, in silence of pride and pain,</div>
<div class="i1">The man who’d led them often, but was never to lead again.</div>
<div class="i1">Think of the secret anguish! think of the dull remorse!</div>
<div class="i1">To see the Hussars sweep past him, unled by the old White Horse!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">An alien, not a stranger; with heart of a comrade still,</div>
<div class="i1">He had borne his sorrow bravely, as a soldier must and will;</div>
<div class="i1">And when the battle was over, in deepening gloom and shade,</div>
<div class="i1">He followed the Staff in silence, and rode to grand parade;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For the Tenth had another hero, all ripe for the General’s praise,</div>
<div class="i1">Who was called to the front that evening by the name of Trooper Hayes;</div>
<div class="i1">He had slashed his way to fortune, when scattered, unhorsed, alone,</div>
<div class="i1">And saving the life of a comrade had managed to guard his own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The General spoke out bravely as ever a soldier can&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“The Army’s proud of your valour; the Regiment’s proud of their man!”</div>
<div class="i1">Then across that lonely desert, at the close of the General’s praise,</div>
<div class="i1">Came a cheer, then a quick short tremble on the lips of Trooper Hayes.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Speak out,” said the kindly Colonel, “if you’ve anything, lad, to say;</div>
<div class="i1">Your Queen and your dear old country shall hear what you’ve done to-day!”</div>
<div class="i1">But the trooper gnawed his chin strap, then sheepishly hung his head;</div>
<div class="i1">“Speak out, old chap!” said his comrades. With an effort, at last, he said&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“There sits by your side on the Staff, sir, a man we are proud to own!</div>
<div class="i1">He was struck down first in the battle, but never was heard to groan;</div>
<div class="i1">If I’ve done aught to deserve it,”&mdash;then the General smiled, “Of course!”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“Give back to the Tenth their Colonel&mdash;the Man on the old White Horse!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I came to the front with my pals here, the boys, and the brave old tars,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve fought for my Queen and my country, and rode with the Tenth Hussars;</div>
<a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a><span class="pageno">88</span>
<div class="i1">I’m proud, of the fine old regiment!”&mdash;then the Colonel shook his hand&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“So I’ll ask one single favour from my Queen and my native land!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“If ever a man bore up, sir, as a soldier should with pluck,</div>
<div class="i1">And fought with a savage sorrow the demon of cursed ill-luck&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That man he sits before you! Give us back, with his wounds and scars,</div>
<div class="i1">The man who has sorely suffered, and is loved by the Tenth Hussars!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then a cheer went up from his comrades, and echoed across the sand,</div>
<div class="i1">And was borne on the wings of mercy to the heart of his native land,</div>
<div class="i1">Where the Queen on her throne will hear it, and the Colonel Prince will praise</div>
<div class="i1">The words of a simple soldier just uttered by Trooper Hayes!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Let the moralist stoop to mercy, that balm of all souls that live;</div>
<div class="i1">For better than all forgetting is the wonderful word “Forgive!”</div>

<div class="i1">Where the woman fought for her honour&mdash;far dearer to her than life;</div>
<div class="i1">When the crash of the opening doorway left her standing outside the cars,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He was “charged” in the good old fashion, as one of the criminal troop,</div>
<div class="i1">With a “Follow me sharp!” from the “Bobby,” which made him tremble and droop;</div>

<div class="i1">Was seen as he went to prison, but nobody cried “Good luck!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Wounded and hurt she sat there, in silence of pride and pain,</div>
<div class="i1">Her womanhood all insulted, her honour left under a stain.</div>

<div class="i1">He reached his port in safety, with few on the grand parade;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the Tenth had another hero, quite right for the General’s praise,</div>
<div class="i1">A thick and thin thoro’ Briton, his name was Trooper Blaze;</div>
<div class="i1">He had never insulted a woman, and scattered unhorsed, alone,</div>
<div class="i1">He had saved the life of a pal of his, and managed to save his own.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The General spoke out bravely as ever a General can:&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">For once the swell and Private could speak as man to man;</div>
<div class="i1">And across the lonely desert, at the close of the General’s praise,</div>
<div class="i1">Came a shout of wonder that the swell could talk to Trooper Blaze.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“Speak out,” said the splendid Colonel, “if you’ve anything, lad, to say;</div>
<div class="i1">Your Queen and your dear old country shall hear what you’ve done to-day!”</div>
<div class="i1">But the Trooper knawed his chin-strap, and sheepishly hung his head;</div>
<div class="i1">“Speak out, old man,” said his comrades, and here’s what he should have said&mdash;</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“There sits on your side by the Staff, sir, a man whom the world has known</div>
<div class="i1">As not a protector of woman, when one’s by herself alone;</div>
<div class="i1">And all he’s got he deserves it&mdash;the General smiled, “Of course;”</div>
<div class="i1">And nobody thought the better of the man on the old White Horse!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“I’ve fought very well for my pals here, along with the boys and tars,</div>
<div class="i1">And I have never&mdash;no, never&mdash;dishonoured the Tenth Hussars;</div>
<div class="i1">But one has done that for the regiment”&mdash;then the Colonel shook his hand&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“So I’ll ask one simple favour from my Queen and my native land!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“If ever a man did wrong, sir, as a thing devoid of pluck,</div>
<div class="i1">And fought with a poor, weak woman, and trusted then to luck&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That man he sits before you, the hero of railway cars&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Don’t let that man be e’er replaced to d&mdash;n the Tenth Hussars!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then a cheer went up from the regiment, and echoed across the sand,</div>
<div class="i1">And was borne on the wings of justice to a woman-loving land,</div>
<div class="i1">When the Queen on her throne will heed it, and the Colonel Prince won’t dare</div>
<div class="i1">To reinstate a man who tried a lady to ensnare.</div>

lady in a railway carriage, sentenced to imprisonment and
dismissed from the English army. He subsequently took

<p class="p2 center larger">THE “JINGO” WAR SONG.</p>

<p>“The men of action got a nickname, they were dubbed
the Jingo Party. The term, applied as one of ridicule and
reproach, was adopted by chivalrous Jingoes as a name of
pride. The Jingoes of London, like the Beggars of
Flanders, accepted the word of contumely as a title of
honour. In order to avoid the possibility of any historical
misunderstanding hereafter about the meaning of Jingo,
such as we have heard of concerning that of Whig and
Tory, it is well to explain how the term came into existence.
Some Tyrtaeus of the tap-tub, some Körner of the music-halls,
had composed a ballad which was sung at one of these
caves of harmony every night, amid the tumultuous applause
of excited patriots. The refrain of this war song contained
the spirit-stirring words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">‘We don’t want to fight; but, by Jingo! if we do</div>
<div class="i1">We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, we’ve got the money too.’</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Some one whose pulses this lyrical outburst of national pride
failed to stir, called the party of its enthusiasts the Jingoes.
The writer of this book is under the impression that the
invention of the name belongs to Mr. George Jacob Holyoake.
The name was caught up at once, and the party
were universally known as the Jingoes. The famous adjuration
of the lady in the ‘Vicar of Wakefield’ had proved to
be too prophetical; she had sworn ‘by the living Jingo,’
and now indeed the Jingo was alive.”&mdash;<cite>A History of Our
Own Times</cite>, by Justin McCarthy, M.P. 1882.</p>

<p>So much for the words, as to the melody, which was not
unmusical, Sir William Fraser wrote to <cite>Notes and Queries</cite> in
May, 1886, saying that it was taken from Mozart’s Twelfth
Mass. But next week the following denial appeared in <cite>N. &amp;
Q.</cite>, “I beg to state, as author and composer of the above
song, that this statement is unwarrantable and devoid of
truth, and in justice to my reputation as a composer, I must
request that you will insert this my denial.&mdash;<span class="sc">G. W. Hunt.</span>”</p>

THE DREAM OF <br />
<span class="larger">THE BILIOUS BEADLE.</span></p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>So many subscribers have asked for a copy
of this clever parody of Thomas Hood’s
<cite>Dream of Eugene Aram</cite> that it is given here,
although it somewhat interferes with the
arrangement of the Song Parodies. “The
Bilious Beadle” is admirably adapted for
public recitation. The author, Mr. Arthur
Shirley, is a well-known dramatist.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">T’was in the grimy winter time, an evening cold and damp,</div>
<div class="i1">And four and twenty work’us boys, all of one ill-fed stamp,</div>
<div class="i1">Were blowing on blue finger tips, bent double with the cramp;</div>
<div class="i1">And when the skilly poured out fell into each urchin’s pan</div>
<div class="i1">They swallowed it at such a pace as only boyhood can.</div>
<div class="i1">But the Beadle sat remote from all, a bilious-looking man&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">His hat was off, red vest apart, to catch the evening breeze&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">He thought that that might cool his brow; it only made him sneeze,</div>
<div class="i1">So pressed his side with his hand, and tried to seem as if at ease.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Heave after heave his waistcoat gave, to him was peace denied,</div>
<div class="i1">It tortured him to see <em>them</em> eat, <em>he</em> couldn’t though he tried!</div>
<div class="i1">Good fare had made him much too fat, and rather goggle eyed,</div>
<div class="i1">At length he started to his feet, some hurried steps he took,</div>
<div class="i1">Now up the ward, now down the ward, with wild dyspeptic look,</div>
<div class="i1">And lo! he saw a work’us boy, who read a penny book&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">“You beastly brat! What is’t you’re at? I warrant ’tis no good!</div>
<div class="i1">What’s this? ‘The life of Turpin Bold!’ or ‘Death of Robin Hood’?”</div>
<div class="i1">“It’s <cite>Hessays on the Crumpet</cite>, sir, as a harticle of food!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He started from that boy as tho’ in’s ear he’d blown a trumpet,</div>
<div class="i1">His hand he pressed upon his chest, then with his fist did thump it,</div>
<div class="i1">And down he sat beside the brat and talked about the crumpet.</div>
<div class="i1">“How now and then that muffin men of whom tradition tells,</div>
<div class="i1">Fortunes had made by pastry trade, and come out awful swells,</div>
<div class="i1">While their old patrons suffered worse than Irving in ‘The Bells!’</div>
<div class="i1">And well, I know,” said he, “forsooth, for plenty have I bought,</div>
<div class="i1">The sufferings of foolish folk who eat more than they ought.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">With pepsine pills and liver pads is their consumption fraught,</div>
<div class="i1">Oh! oh! my boy, my pauper boy! Take my advice, ’tis best shun</div>
<div class="i1">All such tempting tasty things, tho’ nice beyond all question,</div>
<div class="i1">Unless you wish like me to feel the pangs of indigestion!</div>
<div class="i1">One, who had ever made me long&mdash;a muffin man and old&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I watched into a public-house, he called for whisky cold,</div>
<div class="i1">And for one moment left his stock within green baize enrolled.</div>
<div class="i1">I crept up to them, thinking what an appetite I’d got,</div>
<div class="i1">I gloated o’er them lying there elastic and all hot;</div>
<div class="i1">I thought of butter laid on thick, and then I prigged the lot!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I took them home, I toasted them, p’raps upwards of a score,</div>
<div class="i1">And never had so fine a feast on luscious fare before,</div>
<div class="i1">‘And now,’ I said, ‘I’ll go to bed, and dream of eating more.’</div>
<div class="i1">All night I lay uneasily, and rolled from side to side,</div>
<div class="i1">At first without one wink of sleep, no matter how I tried;</div>
<div class="i1">And then I dreamt I was a ’bus, and gurgled ‘Full inside!’</div>
<div class="i1">I was a ’bus by nightmares drawn on to some giddy crest,</div>
<div class="i1">Now launched like lightning through the air, now stop’d, and now compressed;</div>
<div class="i1">I felt a million muffin men were seated on my chest!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">I heard their bells&mdash;their horrid bells&mdash;in sound as loud as trumpets,</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, curses on ye, spongy tribe! Ye cruffins and ye mumpets!</div>
<div class="i1">I must be mad! I mean to say ye muffins and ye crumpets!</div>
<div class="i1">Then came a chill like Wenham ice; then hot as hottest steam;</div>
<div class="i1">I could not move a single limb! I could not even scream!</div>
<div class="i1">You pauper brat, remember that&mdash;all this was but a dream!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The boy gazed on his troubled brow, from which big drops were oozing,</div>
<div class="i1">And for the moment all respect for his dread function losing,</div>
<div class="i1">Made this remark, “Well, blow me tight, our Beadle’s been a-boozing!”</div>
<div class="i1">That very week, before the beak, they brought that beadle burly;</div>
<div class="i1">He pleaded guilty in a tone dyspeptically surly,</div>
<div class="i1">And he lives still at Pentonville with hair not long or curly!</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">THE OLD AND YOUNG COURTIER.</p>

<p>The subject of the following song is a comparison
between the manners of the old gentry,
as still subsisting in the times of Elizabeth, and
the modern refinements affected by their sons
in the reigns of her successors. It is given in
Volume <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> of Percy’s <cite>Reliques of Ancient Poetry</cite>,
where it is stated that it was first printed in
the reign of James the First. Bishop Percy
says he found it among some poems and songs
in a book entitled “Le Prince d’ Amour,”
dated 1660.</p>

<p>It will at once be seen that it is the original
of the more familiar song, <cite>The Fine Old English
Gentleman</cite>, which immediately follows it, and
which, has itself, been the subject of numerous
imitations and parodies.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">

<div class="i1">Of an old worshipful gentleman, who had a greate estate,</div>

<div class="i1">With an old lady, whose anger one word asswages;</div>

</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">With an old study filled full of learned old books,</div>

<div class="i1">With an old falconer, huntsman, and a kennel of hounds,</div>

<div class="i1">I’ll sing you a modern song, that was writ by a man of late,</div>

<div class="i1">And there he often used to sit, and his gin-and-water mix,</div>

<div class="i1">His custom was, when drunk, to go to Barnwell in a fly,</div>

<div class="i1">There’s a fine old song for fine old gents, with fine old wine elate,</div>

<div class="i1">And <cite>Punch</cite> unto that fine old air new-fashioned words would mate,</div>
<div class="i1">Of the fine old Cantab as he was before this change of late&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">The fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His rooms their range of ballet-girls and running-horses showed,</div>
<div class="i1">And a fox-brush, meant to indicate that up to hounds he rode;</div>
<div class="i1">There at vingt-un or loo he’d sit, until the cocks they crowed,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor ever thought of how to pay the various ticks he owed&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">From Eton or from Harrow he came cramm’d with longs and shorts,</div>
<div class="i1">An ambition to drive tandem, and a taste for fruity Ports;</div>
<div class="i1">And his hardest work was playing, till he deafened half the Courts,</div>
<div class="i1">Concertos on the cornet, in keys of different sorts&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">As a Freshman he wore sober ties, and gave a Don the wall,</div>
<div class="i1">But came out, his second year, in short coat and fancy shawl,</div>
<div class="i1">And treated the authorities with no respect at all.</div>
<div class="i1">Was seldom seen at lectures, and never dined in Hall&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So he managed to forget the trifling all he once did know,</div>
<div class="i1">And by a very narrow shave got through his little-go,</div>
<div class="i1">And then he took “a coach” with cram what brains he’d left to stow&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Arithmetic to the Rule of Three, and some Algebra, also&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">This fine old Cantab as he was, all in the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Thus, loo, larks, liquor, and late hours, made time and money fly,</div>
<div class="i1">Till when three years brought on the Poll, he was plucked disgracefully,</div>
<div class="i1">And his disgusted gov’rnor came and paid off, with a sigh,</div>
<div class="i1">Ticks to a tune which nearly sucked the poor old pump quite dry,</div>
<div class="i3">For his fine old Cantab of a son, one of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But times are changed henceforth, we know; for, from eighteen-forty-nine,</div>

<div class="i1">Out of whom he won’t be qualified with ease to take the shine&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Our fine young Cantab that’s to be, all in the future time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">For reading and not racing he’ll have to keep his book,</div>
<div class="i1">He’ll blush at his own pink, and hang his tops upon the hook;</div>
<div class="i1">And if e’er he use a cue, ’twill be for motion’s laws to look;</div>
<div class="i1">And for milk punch he’ll drink his toast&mdash;and water from the brook&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Our fine young Cantab that’s to be, all in the future time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He’ll put off the old Adam for the new one&mdash;Adam Smith;</div>
<div class="i1">Political Economy will bring private, p’r’aps, therewith:</div>
<div class="i1">At Ge&mdash; or else The&mdash;ology he’ll spend his pluck and pith,</div>
<div class="i1">Tea and Theorems ousting loo and lush, which will be all a myth</div>
<div class="i3">To our new Cantab that’s to be, all in the future time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Save for studying the pendulum, he’ll never try a tick;</div>
<div class="i1">A novel definition he’ll invent for the word “brick;”</div>
<div class="i1">Not one who braves the Proctor, or bargee can slang or lick,</div>
<div class="i1">But who digs up Hebrew roots like beans, and knocks off Morals slick&mdash;</div>
<div class="i3">Such our new Cantab is to be, all in the future time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Old Dons will shake their heads, no doubt, and the good old days deplore,</div>
<div class="i1">When reading men were voted slow, and lectures all a bore;</div>
<div class="i1">But still let’s hope that Cambridge will furnish, as of yore,</div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The Common-hall was crowded then with all the Christian’s foes,</div>

<div class="i1">Loud shouted many a Hebrew voice; and many a Hebrew nose</div>
<div class="i1">It’s hook up-raised and Rothschild praised, the man the Hebrews chose.</div>
<div class="i6">He was such a fine Jewish autocrat,</div>
<div class="i6">One of a wealthy kind!</div>

<div class="i1">When Manners came (a man whose name we all have heard before)</div>
<div class="i1">And raised his voice, the Hebrew choice to negative once more,</div>

<div class="i1">I’ll sing you a new song on a theme much stirred of late,</div>
<div class="i1">Of a fine old English Innkeeper, grown rather out of date,</div>
<div class="i1">Who keeps up his establishment in almost princely state,</div>
<div class="i1">And don’t forget to charge you there at quite a princely rate,</div>
<div class="i5">Like a fine old English Innkeeper, one of the olden time.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His house, you’re told, is fitted up “regardless of expense,”</div>
<div class="i1">Although one half is obsolete, and t’other make pretence;</div>
<div class="i1">Exploded old four-posters, built in George the Second’s reign,</div>
<div class="i1">Mock plate to serve mock-turtle in, sham ice-pails for champagne;</div>
<div class="i5">At this fine old English Innkeeper’s, one of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The swipes he draws is sour enough to turn a navvy pale,</div>
<div class="i1">Tho’ by a bitter raillery he calls it bitter ale;</div>
<div class="i1">And tho’ perhaps you don’t see half a waiter all the day,</div>
<div class="i1">For “attendance” quite as much as for a lawyer’s you must pay</div>
<div class="i5">To this fine old English Innkeeper, one of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then if to wine your tastes incline some home-made Cape you’ll get,</div>
<div class="i1">Served up in a decanter like a vinegar-cruet,</div>
<div class="i1">As a “bottle of Madeira” this will in the bill be set,</div>
<div class="i1">And however nasty it may be a nice sum you’re in debt,</div>
<div class="i5">To the fine old English Innkeeper, one of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And if your wife be with you, you must have a private room,</div>

<div class="i1">For which you’ll pay a crown a day, and ’tis a burning shame</div>
<div class="i1">That whether they be lit or not, they’re charged for just the same,</div>
<div class="i5">By this rare old English Innkeeper, one of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But soon these fine old Innkeepers will find their race is run,</div>
<div class="i1">For men are up and doing, and no longer will be done:</div>
<div class="i1">And shortly we may hope to see a really good hotel</div>

<div class="i1">To which our great-great-grandmothers would go in all their state,</div>

<div class="i1">And in blank terms the characters detailed their loves and woes;</div>
<div class="i1">And there the audience sat it out, or took a quiet doze,</div>
<div class="i1">And roused themselves up vig’rously to see the dismal close</div>
<div class="i5">Of this fine old standard tragedy, all of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When winter brought the theatres that open’d house to all,</div>
<div class="i1">Although one score and ten its scenes, through each they yet would bawl:</div>
<div class="i1">Nor was the slightest interest e’er given to enthral,</div>
<div class="i1">And, until five dull acts were o’er, the curtain would not fall,</div>
<div class="i5">On this fine old standard tragedy, all of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But better taste must come at last, and <em>such</em> plays be put by,</div>
<div class="i1">And empty houses soon proclaimed this tragedy must die;</div>
<div class="i1">They gave it up right grudgingly, and not without a sigh,</div>
<div class="i1">And found they must at last look round for sterling novelty,</div>
<div class="i5">Instead of standard tragedies, all of the olden time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And surely this is better far when managers are made</div>
<div class="i1">To shelve these tragedies that have of interest not a shade;</div>
<div class="i1">And much more economical&mdash;for actors then are paid&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Exchequers filled, and houses cramm’d, to see the dramas play’d,</div>

<div class="i1">I sing of one whom now that we’ve begun to educate,</div>

<div class="i1">And he’s able to write legibly, and what is more, compose:</div>

<div class="i1">Quick eye, strong arm, and foot so fleet as ne’er to lag behind;</div>
<div class="i1">Good lungs, and constitution such as no fatigue can feel,</div>
<div class="i1">With iron nerves and sinews, and a heart as true as steel,</div>
<div class="i6">Has this brave young English Officer, to serve us in his prime.</div>

<div class="i1">A Centaur in his horsemanship, an Angelo to fence,</div>

<div class="i1">From battle-fight to fisticuffs good generalship he proves.</div>
<div class="i1">In glory’s race a winner, and a “wunner” with the gloves,</div>

<div class="i1">The winter comes, as winter came some fifty years ago&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Sometimes muggy, warm, and wet, and sometimes frost and snow;</div>
<div class="i1">And, weather notwithstanding, comes the Christmas Cattle Show;</div>
<div class="i1">But the modern English farmer our forefathers wouldn’t know,</div>
<div class="i6">In the fine Young Agriculturist&mdash;one of the modern time.</div>

<div class="i1">He don’t take days to travel up by daily coach and mail,</div>
<div class="i1">And stop at roadside posting-houses, drinking rum and ale.</div>
<div class="i1">Or waste his time to dine, and hear the landlord’s oft-told tale,</div>
<div class="i1">But speeds at forty miles an hour to town express by rail.</div>
<div class="i6">This fine Young Agriculturist, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">In former days his dress was baggy sandy-coloured suits,</div>
<div class="i1">A great top-coat, with pockets deep, knee-breeches and top-boots,</div>

<div class="i1">His coat made small, and cutaway&mdash;his trousers fitting tight.</div>
<div class="i1">His Balmoralish patent leather button boots are light,</div>
<div class="i1">A Champagne Charley glossy hat, curl’d brim, and small in height,</div>
<div class="i6">On this fine Young Agriculturist, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The past young English farmer was so vulgar and ill-bred&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">A gross, fat, clumsy lump of human nature over-fed;</div>

<div class="i1">In public-house, or skittle-ground, and smoke the vulgar clay.</div>
<div class="i1">But, having more refinement, can the game of billiards play,</div>
<div class="i1">Or join the ladies on the lawn at love-making croquet.</div>
<div class="i6">Can this nice Young Agriculturist, &amp;c.</div>

<div class="i1">Now, isn’t this much better that the live-stock should be so,</div>
<div class="i1">Than as seen by our grandfathers some fifty years ago?</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">A PARODY BY CHARLES DICKENS.</p>

<p>The following parody, written by Charles Dickens,
appeared in <cite>The Examiner</cite> for Saturday, August 7, 1841.
Mr. Forster thus refers to it in his <cite>Life of Charles Dickens</cite>:
“The last of these rhymes I will give <em>entire</em>. This has no
touch of personal satire in it, and he would himself, for
that reason, have least objected to its revival.” Thereupon
Mr. Forster quotes seven only out of the eight
stanzas he professes to give in full, omitting one which
quite destroys his assertion that there was no personal
satire in the parody. Mr. Forster was once described
by a cabman as “that ’ere <em>h</em>arbitrary cove;” to give a
garbled quotation, and state that it is the entire poem
is indeed an arbitrary act. The following is a complete
reproduction of Mr. Dickens’s parody:&mdash;</p>

man of fifty! In short, this <cite>delightful, blissful, wise, pleasureable,
honourable, virtuous, true and immortal</cite> Prince was a
violator of his word, a libertine over head and ears in disgrace, a
despiser of domestic ties, the companion of gamblers and demireps, a
man who has just closed half a century without one single claim on
the gratitude of his country, or the respect of posterity.”

The Hunts were informed that if they would undertake
to abstain from commenting on the actions of the Prince
Regent for the future the sentence would be remitted. They
declined to give the required undertaking, but paid their
fines, and went to prison. The severity of the sentence
caused great delight to the friends of the Prince Regent, and
Theodore Hook wrote the following apropos parody of
Cowper’s poem on Alexander Selkirk:&mdash;</p>

<p>Severe as was the punishment inflicted on the Hunts it
did not have a deterrent effect; indeed the trial was a
political blunder, it gave enormous publicity to a libel which
would otherwise have been seen by few, and have soon been
forgotten; it offended many, who whilst having no sympathy
with the Hunts, were still in favour of a free Press; and finally
it encouraged the publication and sale of many other attacks
upon the Prince Regent, and his friends. The most active
and zealous purveyor of this kind of literature was William
Hone, of Ludgate Hill, who published numerous pamphlets,
leaflets, parodies and squibs; most of these were written by
Hone himself, and illustrated by George Cruikshank. The
Prince Regent’s personal appearance, his intemperance, his
vanity, and his conduct towards his wife, were mercilessly
exposed and ridiculed; whilst the actions of the ministry
were also held up to public scorn and contempt.</p>

<p>Eventually the government took legal proceedings against
Hone for publishing political parodies, namely, John Wilkes’s
Catechism, the Political Litany, and the Sinecurist’s Creed.</p>

<p>There were three separate trials held in the Guildhall,
London, on December 18, 19 and 20, 1817, and in each trial
the Jury found a verdict of <cite>Not Guilty</cite>. Here, again, the
government prosecutions defeated their own ends. Hone
became the hero of the day, the martyr in the cause of the
liberty of the Press; a large sum of money was raised for him
by public subscription, and what was worse, the parodies were
republished, and, owing to the publicity given to them by the
trials, the sales were enormous. Even now these little pamphlets
are eagerly sought after by collectors of literary <a name="c7" id="c7"></a>curiosities, and
of <cite>Cruikshankiana</cite>, especially those relating to the Prince
Regent and his illtreated wife. The most successful example
of Hone’s skill was a parody entitled “The House that Jack
built,” of which more than fifty editions were rapidly sold
off. A few extracts will show the bitter tone of this parody;
and Cruikshank’s portrait of the <cite>Dandy of Sixty</cite> was scarcely
more complimentary than Leigh Hunt’s written description
of the “fat Adonis of fifty.” The subjects of Cruikshank’s
illustrations are given within parenthesis.</p>

<p>The Report of Hone’s three Trials is an interesting work,
full of curious parodies, of which a detailed account will be
given in the Bibliographical Volume of this Collection. But
for the present Leigh Hunt, William Hone, George Cruikshank,
and George, Regent, and King, must be dismissed, and
Thackeray’s burlesque Epitaph will fitly close this chapter.</p>

<p>This song was first printed complete in Walsh’s “British
Miscellany” about 1740. It was written and composed by
Richard Leveridge, with the exception of the first two verses
which were written by Henry Fielding, for a comedy entitled
“Don Quixote in England.” This piece was acted at the
New-Theatre in the Haymarket, 1733.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Robert Southey calls this “the political hymn
of our Country,” and it may certainly be regarded
as the British National Song. There has been
some controversy as to its authorship, it is
generally ascribed to James Thomson, author
of “The Seasons,” whilst others have assigned
it to David Mallet. The arguments are too
lengthy to be reproduced here, but the chief
points of the discussion are to be found in
letters from Mr. William Chappell, and Mr.
Julian Marshall, published in “Notes and
Queries,” August 14, November 20, and
December 18, 1886. Possibly both Thomson
and Mallet joined in the composition of the <em>ode</em>

(as they styled it), but this question can now
never be authoritatively settled. No doubt exists
however that the music was composed by Dr.
Thomas Arne, and by it, and the chorus, Rule
Britannia is known all the world over.</p>

<p class="blockquote">On the 1st August, 1740, a Masque styled <em>Alfred</em>, written
by James Thomson and David Mallet, was performed in the
gardens of Cliefdon House, in commemoration of the accession
of George <abbr title="One">I.</abbr>, before the Prince and Princess of Wales.
The plot of the Masque was based on the gallant struggles of
King Alfred with the Danes, it abounded with patriotic
allusions, and <cite>Rule Britannia</cite> was thus introduced in scene 5,
Act 2.</p>

<p class="blockquote">“Here is seen the Ocean in prospect, and ships sailing
along. Two boats land their crews. One Sailor sings
the following ode; after which the rest join in a lively
Dance.”</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">GOD SAVE THE KING.</p>

<p>The most remarkable feature about “God save the
King,” (or Queen) is the great uncertainty which exists as to
its origin. There seems little doubt that the melody is
German, but it is not known when, or by whom, it was imported,
whilst the words have been handed down, with slight
verbal alterations, since the days when James the First was
congratulated on his escape from the Gunpowder Plot.</p>

<p>The words as they were then sung were written by Dr. John
Bull, to whom some also ascribe the melody; Germans
assert that it was imported into England by Handel, whilst
others state that either Lulli, or Purcell, was the composer.</p>

<p>George Saville Carey claimed both the words and the
melody as the productions of his father, Henry Carey (the
author of “Sally in our Alley,”) and one hypothesis is, that no
other song writer could have been guilty of such atrocious
rhymes as are to be found in the anthem:</p>

<table summary="">
<tr><td class="left pad6">Victorious.</td><td class="left">|&emsp;Laws.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left pad6">Glorious.</td><td class="left">|&emsp;Cause.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left pad6">Over us.</td><td class="left">|&emsp;Voice.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There is no doubt that Henry Carey had some part in
settling the words, as they are now known, whilst
as to the melody the most likely supposition is that he
adopted German music in honour of the House of
Brunswick, for the same air was at once the Royal Hymn
for Prussia, Saxony, Weimar, <cite>Brunswick</cite> and <cite>Hanover</cite>; the
German version known as “<cite lang="de" xml:lang="de">Heil Dir im Sieger Kranz</cite>” is
still the official anthem of the German Empire. This theory
is far more probable than are the various other conjectures as
to its origin, such as that it was either a Scotch, French, or
Jacobite Song. The grand simplicity of the air is almost
sufficient proof of its German origin, and it is far more probable

<p>The tradition is, that the composer Handel, obtained leave
to copy the air and words, which he submitted to George the
First as his own composition.”</p>

<p>The importation of the air of “God save the King,”
appears undeniable, but it certainly did not come from France,
neither is there anything to show that Handel passed it off as
his own composition. Indeed in a court mainly composed of
Germans, and before a German King, to whom the air must
have been familiar from early childhood, such an attempt
would have been ridiculous.</p>

<p>Many interesting facts bearing on these disputed questions
will be found in an account of the National Anthem, entitled,
“God save the King,” by Richard Clarke; London, W.
Wright, Fleet Street, 1822; also in “Old National Airs,”
by W. Chappell; “The Music of the Church,” by Thomas

Hirst; and “An Introduction to the study of National
Music,” by Carl Engel, London, 1866.</p>

<p>These authorities are not agreed as to the origin of the
melody, but they all assert that words, somewhat similar to
those now in use, were written to congratulate James the
First on his escape from the Gunpowder Plot, and were sung
for the first time at an entertainment given to that King in
July 1607 in the Hall of the Merchant Tailors’ Company, in
the City of London.</p>

<p>Indeed, the balance of evidence tends to prove that the
song never was intended for the House of Hanover, whose
anthem it has become, but for the Stuart family. Up to the
time of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> the national anthem-sung in honour of the
king was “Vive le Roy”&mdash;an English song with a Norman
burden. After the revolution that made Cromwell Protector,
the Cavaliers, without utterly discarding the old song, made
themselves a new one&mdash;“When the King shall enjoy his own
again,” which, with its by no means contemptible poetry,
and its exceedingly fine music, kept up the heart of the party
in their adversity, and did more for the royal cause than an
army.</p>

<p>In the reigns of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, when the King
had come into the full possession of his own, the loyal song
was, “Here’s a Health unto his Majesty.” Later on, when
the Stuarts were in exile, it would seem that Carey revived
“God save the King,” but that it did not become popular
until 1745, about two years after his death.</p>

<p>George Saville Carey in <cite>The Balnea</cite> (London, 1801) gives
the following account of the origin of <cite>God save the King</cite>:</p>

<p class="blockquote">“In spite of all literary cavil and conjectural assertion
there has not yet appeared one <em>identity</em> to invalidate the
truth that my father was the author of that important
song, some have given the music to Handel, others to
Purcell, some have signified that it was produced in the time
of Charles <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> others James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> and some, in their slumbers,
have dreamed that it made its appearance in the reign of
Henry <abbr title="Eight">VIII.</abbr> it might as well have been carried still further
back, to the reign of song-singing Solomon, or psalm singing
David. I have heard the late Mr. Pearce Galliard
assert, time after time, that my father was the author of
“God save the King”; that it was produced in the year
1745-6, and printed in the year 1750, for John Johnson,
opposite Bow Church, in Cheapside. But, for the satisfaction
of my readers, I will insert the song of ‘God save the
King,’ as it is printed in the original text, where it is called
a song for two voices:&mdash;</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Henry Carey was the author
of the first three verses of this particular version of the song,
but he could not have written the fourth verse, as he committed
suicide in 1743, two years before the Scotch rebellion
to which the verse refers.</p>

<p>The first time that the song or anthem of “God save the
King” was made known generally to the public was at the end
of the month of September, 1745 after the young Pretender’s
forces had beaten Sir John Cope, and Prince Charles himself
had made his triumphant entry into Holyrood Palace. “On
Saturday night,” says the <cite>Daily Advertiser</cite> of September
30th, 1745, “the audience at the Theatre Royal, Drury
Lane were agreeably surprised by the gentlemen belonging
to that house performing the anthem of ‘God save our noble
King.’” Another paper, the <cite>General Advertiser</cite>, of October
2nd, said&mdash;“At the Theatre in Goodman’s Fields, by desire,
‘God save the King,’ as it was performed at the Theatre
Royal, Drury Lane, was sung with great applause.” That
the song was a novelty is proved not only by these records,
but by a letter from Benjamin Victor to David Garrick, bearing
date October, 1745. The writer says&mdash;“The stage at both
houses is the most pious as well as the most loyal place
in the three kingdoms. Twenty men appear at the end of
every play, and one stepping forward from the rest, with uplifted
hands and eyes, begins singing to an <cite>old anthem tune</cite> the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">‘Oh, Lord our God, arise,</div>
<div class="i1">Confound the enemies</div>
<div class="i2">Of George our King;</div>
<div class="i1">Send him victorious,</div>
<div class="i1">Happy and glorious,</div>
<div class="i1">Long to reign over us</div>
<div class="i2">God save the King.</div>

<p>He adds, “These are the very words and music of an old
anthem that was sung at St James’s Chapel for King James
<abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, when the Prince of Orange landed to deliver us from
Popery and Slavery, which God Almighty, in his goodness,
was pleased not to grant.”</p>

<p>From that time <cite>God save the King</cite> became the recognised
official and loyal song, or anthem, but it is, of course, incorrect
to style it the <cite>National Anthem</cite>, in the sense that <cite>Rule
Britannia is National</cite>, as it is simply a prayer for the Royal
Family. Richard Brinsley Sheridan wrote an impromptu
verse, which was sung at Drury Lane Theatre, in 1800, on
the night when Hatfield fired from the pit of that theatre at
George <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> It is scarcely necessary to observe that Sheridan’s
verse, <em>as poetry</em>, is immeasurably superior to the older
portion of the anthem:&mdash;</p>

corporation acts. Pitt and Burke opposed any such concession
to the dissenters, and the motion was rejected by nearly
three to one. A great agitation was got up, all over the country,

injudicious alterations made in the prices, and structural
arrangements by John Kemble. He raised the prices partly
in order to pay high salaries to Madame Catalani and other
foreigners. The war cries of the rioters were “Old Prices!
No Private Boxes! No Catalani! The English Drama!”,
many songs and parodies were written to annoy Kemble,
who had, eventually, to compromise matters, and Madame
Catalani’s name was withdrawn from the bills. This lady

electors of Greenwich on Blackheath. In the course of his
speech he referred to the number of reforms that had been
carried out during his political career; but, he added, that
whilst much remained to be done, we must not flatter ourselves
that all the evils of humanity could be cured by
legislation. He then quoted the first verse of the following
parody, stating that he had met with it in a “questionable
book.” The “questionable book” was <cite>The Secularist’s
Manual of Songs and Ceremonies</cite>. Edited by Austin Holyoake
and Charles Watts, with a Preface by Charles Bradlaugh.
There was a loud outcry against Mr. Gladstone for quoting
from such a source.</p>

<p class="center">THE SONGS OF</p>

<h3 class="h3head">Mr. W. S. GILBERT.</h3>

<p>Although Mr. W. S. Gilbert has long been
before the public as a dramatist and humorous
author, his chief title to fame rests upon the
long series of successful comic operas produced
either at the Opera Comique, or the Savoy
Theatre. In all of these the quaint fancies and
humorous dialogues of Mr. Gilbert, were supplemented
by the brilliant and tuneful music
of Sir Arthur Sullivan. Their creations, placed
upon the stage with attention to every detail,
and interpreted by a powerful company, have,
for the last ten years, been the chief theatrical
attraction, of a lighter sort, in the metropolis.
The following is a list of these operas, with

parodies of some of the favourite songs contained
in them:&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>Thespis</cite>; or, The Gods grown old.</p>

<p><cite>Trial by Jury.</cite> A novel and original dramatic Cantata.
Opera Comique Theatre. 1876.</p>

<p><cite>The Sorcerer.</cite> A modern Comic opera 1877. It was in this
opera that the inimitable actor, Mr. George Grossmith, made
his first appearance on the stage in the part of “<cite>John Wellington
Wells, a dealer in magic and spells</cite>.”</p>

<p><cite>H.M.S. Pinafore</cite>; or, The Lass that loved a Sailor.
An entirely original Nautical Comic opera. Opera Comique
Theatre. May 25, 1878.</p>

<p><cite>The Pirates of Penzance</cite>; or, The Slave of Duty. An
original Melo-Dramatic opera. Opera Comique Theatre.
1880.</p>

<p><cite>Patience</cite>; or, Bunthorne’s Bride. An Æsthetic opera.
Opera Comique Theatre. April 23, 1881.</p>

<p><cite>Iolanthe</cite>; or, The Peer and the Peri. An entirely original
Fairy opera. Savoy Theatre, November 25, 1882.</p>

<p><cite>Princess Ida</cite>; or, Castle Adamant. Savoy Theatre
January 5, 1884.</p>

<p><cite>The Mikado</cite>; or, The Town of Titipu. An entirely original
Japanese opera. Savoy Theatre. March 14, 1885.</p>

<p><cite>Ruddygore</cite>; or, The Witch’s Curse. An entirely original
Supernatural opera. (The leading word in the title was
afterwards altered to <cite>Ruddigore</cite>.) Savoy Theatre. January
22, 1887.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">or, Bunthorne’s Bride!</span></p>

<p>This delightful opera was produced on Saturday,
<abbr title="twenty-third">23rd</abbr> April, 1881, at a time when the
Æsthetic movement was the talk of London,
and Mr. Burnand’s vamped-up old play, with the
new and meaningless title, <cite>The Colonel</cite>, was
drawing crowded houses. The plot of <cite>The
Colonel</cite> was taken from Mr. Morris Barnett’s
<cite>The Serious Family</cite>, produced in 1849, whereas
Mr. Gilbert’s plot was entirely original, and
although it was not performed until April, 1881,
the libretto of <cite>Patience</cite> was completed in November,
1880.</p>

<p>In both pieces the main idea was to ridicule
Æstheticism and the Æsthetes; in <cite>The Colonel</cite>
this was effected by representing the movement
as a sham, and its votaries as humbugs and
swindlers; in <cite>Patience</cite> the style, manners, and
conversation of the extreme Æsthetes were so
gently and gracefully exaggerated, that even
the most Utter and Intense amongst them could
scarcely take offence at its lively sarcasms.</p>

<p>The excitement about Æstheticism has now
subsided, but the beneficial results of this
artistic movement are to be seen on every side.
In house building, furniture, and decoration;
in china, pottery, and glass, even in ladies
costumes, far more taste and skill are now
displayed than prior to this much ridiculed
Renaissance of Art and Culture, which was inaugurated
<a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a><span class="pageno">122</span>
by the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood,
consisting of Dante Gabriel Rossetti; W. M.
Rossetti; William Morris; John Ruskin; Holman
Hunt; and Thomas Woolner.</p>

<p>Further details on this subject would be out
of place in this collection, but a full account
will be found in <cite>The Æsthetic Movement in
England</cite>, published by Messrs. Reeves and
Turner, London, 1882.</p>

<p>When <cite>The Times</cite> had some pretensions to the title of the
leading English newspaper, it was known as “The Thunderer
of Printing House Square,” but it has recently been
re-christened <cite>The Blunderer; or, the Political Weathercock</cite>, a
name which recalls the subsidiary titles Mr. Gilbert gives to
all his operas. The silly misprints, and other errors, which
are to be found daily in <cite>The Times</cite> show the careless manner
in which it is edited, whilst several disgraceful hoaxes
practised upon it by the compositors on its staff, prove how
unpopular the management must have been, and that a
chronic state of mutiny existed in Printing House Square.
One of these practical jokes was perpetrated on <cite>The Times</cite>
by an audacious compositor, who altered an advertisement
which appeared on Tuesday, February 21, 1882, so that it
read:&mdash;<cite>On the 20th instant, at &mdash; Park Lane, W., the wife
of</cite> <span class="sc">Albert Edward</span>, <cite>of a son</cite>.” Whilst a still worse hoax
appeared in <cite>The Times</cite> of Monday, June 12, 1882, in an
advertisement of a book entitled <cite>Every-Day Life in our
Public Schools</cite>, which title was amplified in a manner never
contemplated by the editor.</p>

<p>But the grossest case of all was that contained in the
report of a speech delivered at Burton-on-Trent by Sir William
Vernon Harcourt, then Home Secretary. This speech was
reported at length in <cite>The Times</cite> of Monday, January 23,
1882, and thousands of copies were sold before the infallible
authorities found out that the pompous Sir W. V. Harcourt’s
speech had been adorned, by their compositors, with flowers
of speech of a very unclassical nature. Every effort was
then made to call in the unsold copies, but the mischief
was done, and for weeks <cite>The Times</cite> was the laughing stock
of London, and fabulous prices were given for copies containing
the objectionable paragraph.</p>

<div class="i1">When first I went to Parliament I gazed with mock humility,</div>
<div class="i2">On Gladstone and on Hartington, on Derby and on Bright;</div>
<div class="i1">I followed their directions with unquestioning docility,</div>
<div class="i2">And said that what they bid me do must certainly be right.</div>
<div class="i6">I flattered all and each of them,</div>
<div class="i6">And daily did beseech of them</div>
<div class="i4">Some counsel or advice, which I accepted with civility.</div>
<div class="i6">I hastened to defer to them;</div>
<div class="i6">When talking, I said “Sir” to them;</div>
<div class="i4">And all my early conduct was remarkably polite,</div>
<div class="i6">I bowed to them,</div>
<div class="i6">Kowtowed to them,</div>
<div class="i5">Each day from morn till night:</div>
<div class="i6">I laughed with them,</div>
<div class="i6">And chaffed with them,</div>
<div class="i5">And played the parasite.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But as the proverb predicates, complete familiarity</div>
<div class="i2">Affects a mam’s ideals with a kind of moral blight:</div>
<div class="i1">And G. and H. and D. and B. (observe the singularity!)</div>
<div class="i2">Revealed defects of character that shocked their proselyte.</div>
<div class="i1">I could no longer follow them, or go to them as reference;</div>
<div class="i2">Their methods, I discovered, differed totally from mine:</div>
<div class="i1">And therefore I reluctantly, and quite against my preference,</div>
<div class="i2">Informed them, “Either you or I, good people must resign.”</div>
<div class="i6">They simply would not hear of it:</div>
<div class="i6">They had the greatest fear of it:</div>
<div class="i4">They treated what I said to them with unaccustomed deference:</div>
<div class="i6">They never would demur to me:</div>
<div class="i6">They even whispered “Sir” to me;</div>
<div class="i4">And one and all they flattered me, and asked me home to dine.</div>
<div class="i6">They bowed to me,</div>
<div class="i6">Kowtowed to me:</div>
<div class="i5">And how could I decline?</div>
<div class="i6">I sneered at them</div>
<div class="i6">And jeered at them,</div>
<div class="i5">But went, and drank their wine.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Don’t talk to me of impudence, deception, or audacity.</div>
<div class="i2">I worried them, I flurried them, I worked upon their fears:</div>
<div class="i1">And now they duly recognise my value and capacity,</div>

<p>Messrs. Lever Brothers, of Warrington, have

<div class="i1">Of gowns and things all stowed away, as safe as underground.</div>

<div class="i1">For, hearing her experience, I remembered with a sigh,</div>

<div class="i4">So I sent at once for Sunlight Soap, and soon unpicked the lace,</div>
<div class="i4">From that old discarded sunshade and I tacked it in its place;</div>
<div class="i4">Round a muslin-covered bottle, as their little books direct,</div>

<div class="i1">The same success attended each experiment I tried,</div>
<div class="i2">And they’ll never more be missed They’ll never more be missed!</div>
<div class="i4">The finest fabrics were unharmed, the tints remained intact,</div>
<div class="i4">You may think I’m romancing, I assure you it’s a fact;</div>
<div class="i4">You try the Sunlight Soap, you’ll find your labour much reduced,</div>
<div class="i4">I only wish that years ago it had been introduced!</div>
<div class="i4">Henceforth no more soiled garments will appear upon my list,</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">RUDDIGORE;</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">or, The Witch’s Curse.</span></p>

<p>This opera, produced at the Savoy Theatre
on Saturday, January 22, 1887, did not at first
receive that approval which the Press and
the public have hitherto accorded to Messrs.
Gilbert and Sullivan’s pieces. Objection was
taken to the title, and in deference to public
opinion the first word was altered from <cite>Ruddygore</cite>
to <cite>Ruddigore</cite>, whilst several passages which
occur in the published version of the libretto
are either altered, or omitted, in representation,
and generally the piece runs more smoothly
than it did when first produced.</p>

<p>That Mr. Gilbert himself had some mistrust
of his own passion for logical paradoxes may
<a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a><span class="pageno">137</span>
be inferred from the fact that the following
passage has, from the first, been omitted in
the performance:</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> It’s not too late, is it?</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> Oh Roddy! (<span class="stagedirection">bashfully</span>).</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> I’m quite respectable now, you know.</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> But you’re a ghost, ain’t you?</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> Well yes&mdash;a kind of ghost.</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> But what would be my legal <em>status</em> as a ghost’s
wife?</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> It would be a very respectable position.</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> But I should be the wife of a dead husband,
Roddy!</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> No doubt.</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> But the wife of a dead husband is a widow, Roddy</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> I suppose she is.</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> And a widow is at liberty to marry again, Roddy!</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> Dear me, yes&mdash;that’s awkward. I never thought
of that.</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> No, Roddy&mdash;I thought you hadn’t.</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> When you’ve been a ghost for a considerable time
it’s astonishing how foggy you become!</p>

<p>The acting copy now also dispenses with the
equally ingenious quibbles which appeared to
give offence to the audience on the first night,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><cite>Robin.</cite> Stop a bit&mdash;both of you.</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> This intrusion is unmannerly.</p>

<p><cite>Han.</cite> I’m surprised at you.</p>

<p><cite>Robin.</cite> I can’t stop to apologise&mdash;an idea has just occurred
to me. A Baronet of Ruddygore can only die through refusing
to commit his daily crime.</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> No doubt.</p>

<p><cite>Robin.</cite> Therefore, to refuse to commit a daily crime is
tantamount to suicide!</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> It would seem so.</p>

<p><cite>Robin.</cite> But suicide is, itself, a crime&mdash;and so, by your own
showing, you ought none of you to have ever died at all!</p>

<p><cite>Red.</cite> I see&mdash;I understand! We are all practically alive!</p>

<p><cite>Robin.</cite> Every man jack of you!</p>

<p><cite>Rod.</cite> My brother ancestors! Down from your frames!
(<span class="stagedirection">The Ancestors descend.</span>) You believe yourselves to be dead&mdash;you
may take it from me that you’re not, and an application
to the Supreme Court is all that is necessary to prove that
you never ought to have died at all!</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="stagedirection">The Ancestors embrace the Bridesmaids.</span>)</p>

<p>From the omission of this conversation it
now follows that the “ancestors,” having once
returned to their picture frames, remain there.</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">An Appeal, after E. A. Poe.</span></div>
<div class="i1">Once upon a midnight dreary, Gilbert pondered weak and weary,</div>
<div class="i1">Thinking of a curious title his new Comic Opera for,</div>
<div class="i1">When a volume from him flinging, suddenly there came a ringing,</div>
<div class="i1">As of some one madly clinging to the bell at his front door;</div>
<div class="i1">“It is D’Oyly Carte,” he muttered, “ringing at my big front door,</div>
<div class="i5">Merely this, and nothing more.”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Poking then the glowing ember, for ’twas cold as bleak December,</div>
<div class="i1">Gilbert said, “Ah, I remember in the olden time of yore,</div>
<div class="i1">Yea, and shall forget it never, though I were to live for ever,</div>
<div class="i1">How I vainly did endeavour once to see my ‘Pinafore;’</div>
<div class="i1">Sat and suffered awful anguish in the stalls at ‘Pinafore,’</div>
<div class="i5">Just that once, but nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“For the feeling sad uncertain, at the rising of the curtain.</div>
<div class="i1">Thrilled me, filled me with such terrors, that a solemn oath I swore,</div>
<div class="i1">And the oath have oft repeated, that though kings and queens entreated,</div>
<div class="i1">I would ne’er again be seated in the stalls as once before,</div>
<div class="i1">There to try and see the piece through, as I tried to do before,</div>
<div class="i5">Now to do so nevermore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Open here was flung the portal by a pompous powdered mortal,</div>
<div class="i1">Who then ushered Mr. Carte in, as he oft had done before;</div>
<div class="i1">Not a moment stopped or stayed he, but a slight obeisance made he,</div>
<div class="i1">And in voice of thunder said he, “Mr. Carte,”&mdash;then slammed the door,</div>
<div class="i1">And in tones stentorian said he, “Mr. Carte,”&mdash;then slammed the door,</div>
<div class="i5">Only this, and nothing more.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Mr.Carte then said quite coolly, “Mr. Gilbert, tell me truly,</div>
<div class="i1">Have you found a proper title our new Comic Opera for?</div>
<div class="i1">Tell this soul with sorrow laden, as you hope to go to Aidenn,</div>
<div class="i1">Have you really, really made ’un? Tell, O tell me, I implore!</div>
<div class="i1">Tell me what its funny name is&mdash;tell, O tell me, I implore!”</div>
<div class="i5">Answered Gilbert&mdash;“Ruddygore!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Carte uprose, alarmed, astounded, by this title much confounded,</div>
<div class="i1">For this word of dreadful meaning such a world of horror bore;</div>
<div class="i1">And he said, “This title gruesome, I feel very sure will do some</div>
<div class="i1">Injury, and we shall lose some thousands ere this piece is o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">Such a name will surely ruin both your words and Arthur’s score;</div>
<div class="i5">Therefore change it, I implore.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then said Gilbert, calmly smoking, “D’Oyly Carte, you must be joking;</div>
<div class="i1">I have never found a title that I liked so much before,</div>
<div class="i1">For it gives the play the seeming of a drama that is teeming</div>
<div class="i1">With deeds of blood all streaming, which the people gloat so o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">Of those deeds all grim and ghastly that the people gloat so o’er;</div>
<div class="i5">Therefore be it Ruddygore,”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And with title so unfitting, people still are nightly sitting</div>
<div class="i1">In the gallery, stalls, and boxes, from the ceiling to the floor;</div>
<div class="i1">And although they can’t help glancing at D. Lely when he’s dancing,</div>
<div class="i1">Think Miss Brandram’s song entrancing, and give Grossmith an encore,</div>
<div class="i1">Still all cry, “Oh, Gilbert, Gilbert, change this title, ‘Ruddygore.’</div>
<div class="i5">Not in spelling&mdash;we want more.”</div>

<p>Although <cite>Ruddigore</cite> is, in itself, a burlesque, it occurred
to Mr. Toole that some fun might be got out of a caricature
of it, and accordingly Messrs. Taylor and Percy Reeve composed
<a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a><span class="pageno">139</span>
a “musical parody” entitled <cite>Ruddy George</cite>, which was
produced at Toole’s Theatre. Much talent for mimicry was
displayed by the principal performers, and especially by Mr.
E. D. Ward, as Robin Redbreast (after George Grossmith)
and Mr. Skelton, as Sir Gaspard, in a droll imitation of Rutland
Barrington’s portentious manner. The burlesque was,
however, most successful in so far as it caricatured the idiosyncracies
and eccentricities of Sir Arthur Sullivan’s music.
In imitation of the scene in Act <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> of the original, where the
portraits of Sir Ruthven’s forefathers descend from their
frames, kitcat panel likenesses of Mr. Gilbert, Sir Arthur
Sullivan, and Mr. D’Oyly Carte suddenly become endowed
with life, and utter some mild, and rather pointless jests.</p>

<p>A small volume has recently been published by Messrs.
Chatto and Windus (London), entitled Mr. Gilbert’s <cite>Original
Comic Operas</cite>, it contains The Sorcerer, H. M. S. Pinafore,
The Pirates of Penzance, Iolanthe, Patience, Princess Ida,

The Mikado, and Trial by Jury. It gives the dates when these
pieces were first produced, but unfortunately omits the names
of the performers, which all playgoers and collectors of
theatrical curiosities will regret.</p>

<p>Numerous imitations and parodies exist of Mr. Gilbert’s
writings, other than those connected with Sir Arthur
Sullivan’s music, thus his mythological play <cite>Pygmalion and
Galatea</cite> was burlesqued by Miss Alice Maud Meadows in
“<cite>Chiselling Pygmalion</cite>,” which was performed in London in
December, 1883, by the members of the Grantham Lawn
Tennis Club.</p>

<p>A jocular guide to the Edinburgh Exhibition of 1886 was
compiled by Mr. George Stronach, and published by Robert
Mitchell, of Edinburgh. It was entitled “<cite>Our Own-eries</cite>;
or, The Show in the Meadows; a <em>dog</em>-gerel <em>cat</em>-alogue,” and
was profusely and humourously illustrated. It contained
several amusing parodies on <cite>The Mikado</cite>, and one on
Tennyson’s <cite>Brook</cite>, but as they related only to the Exhibition
they were of purely local interest, and are now out of date.</p>

<p>In <cite>The Bab Ballads</cite>, which originally appeared in <cite>Fun</cite>
(London), may be found the germs of several of Mr. Gilbert’s
plays and operas, sketches of plots afterwards amplified,
and snatches of song which were, later on, to be linked to
Arthur Sullivan’s music, and so made famous.</p>

<p>The following, which appeared in <cite>Fun</cite> twenty years ago,
contains part of the plot of <cite>H. M. S. Pinafore</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>To the air of the ‘Precocious Baby.’</cite>)</div>
<div class="i1">A monarch of Burmah, I cannot tell why,</div>
<div class="i4">With his sips and ‘nips’</div>
<div class="i4">For his parched-up lips,</div>
<div class="i1">Was plagued with a throat so excessively dry,</div>
<div class="i4">’Twas useless to try</div>
<div class="i4">To ‘wet t’other eye,’</div>
<div class="i1">Because he was perfectly, perfectly dry.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Twas shocking in one of exalted degree,</div>
<div class="i4">With his ‘Pour a drop more,</div>
<div class="i4">Encore and encore,’</div>
<div class="i1">’Twas painfully sad for the monarch of B.,</div>
<div class="i4">As thirsty was he</div>
<div class="i4">As a fish from the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">As thirsty, as thirsty, as thirsty could be.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His ministers tried to relieve him at first</div>
<div class="i4">With coffee and tea</div>
<div class="i4">And soda-and-b.,</div>
<div class="i1">But couldn’t relieve his insatiable thirst;</div>
<div class="i4">They all did their worst</div>
<div class="i4">For the King, who was curst</div>
<div class="i1">From youth with a singular, singular thirst.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Of each kind of tipple they brought a supply</div>
<div class="i4">(With whisky and brandy,</div>
<div class="i4">And other drinks handy),</div>
<div class="i1">And wept that their monarch should still remain dry;</div>
<div class="i4">But laugh when he’d try</div>
<div class="i4">With his jester to vie,</div>
<div class="i1">For even his jokes were exceedingly dry.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They gathered in Hungary, Portugal, Spain,</div>
<div class="i4">On the banks of the Rhine,</div>
<div class="i4">Many hogsheads of wine,</div>
<div class="i1">Which were drunk (so was <em>he</em>), but he still cried ‘A drain!’</div>
<div class="i4">’Twas perfectly plain</div>
<div class="i4">All their labours were vain;</div>
<div class="i1">He kept on repeating, ‘Go fetch me a drain!’</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then a royal commission his Majesty sent,</div>
<div class="i4">With his ‘Pass me a glass</div>
<div class="i4">Of the bitter of Bass!’</div>
<div class="i1">To buy all the liquor of Burton-on-Trent.</div>
<div class="i4">But after they went</div>

<p>The April number of <cite>Macmillan’s Magazine</cite>
contained the Poet Laureate’s contribution to
Jubilee literature. As usual, portions of the
Ode were quoted in the London papers almost
before the magazine was published, and
<cite>The Daily News</cite> went so far as to reprint the
whole of the Ode, an infringement of Messrs.
Macmillan’s rights, for which an apology had
to be made. As to the poetical merits of the
Ode public opinion has been tolerably well
expressed by the parodies on it which have
appeared. A few verses of the original are
here given, to lead up to the parodies.</p>

<p><cite>The Globe</cite> remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It is to be feared that the Laureate’s Jubilee Ode will
sadly disappoint all his admirers. It has a certain rhetorical
neatness, no doubt; but it cannot be regarded as adequate
to the occasion. The poet has chosen, for the most part,
very prosaic rhythms, and the Ode, trite and even common
in ideas, is not even endowed with occasional felicities of
expression, On the contrary, it is sometimes positively unlucky
in its phraseology, as when the world is most unnecessarily
assured that Her Majesty has about her&mdash;</p>

<p>“By no means happy are the references to those who
‘wanton in affluence’ (why ‘wanton?’) to the ‘Lord manufacturers,’
and to the ‘Imperial Institute,’ which latter
surely savours a little of bathos? The six concluding lines
have more inspiration, perhaps, than most; but they do not
harmonise very well in their allusion to ‘thunders moaning
in the distance,’ with the Laureate’s allusion elsewhere to
the ‘prosperous auguries’ of the Jubilee. On the whole,
Lord Rosslyn, Mr. Morris, and Lord Tennyson having all
spoken, it must be confessed that the Jubilee still lacks a

<p>9 <span class="sc lowercase">A.M.</span>&mdash;Bother the Jubilee! What in the name of
fortune, can one do with such a rubbishing subject? But
here’s <cite>Macmillan</cite> waiting, and I haven’t done a single line
yet. Must get something put on to paper, if only to quiet
him. But how on earth to begin! Get in “fifty” somehow.
Want fifty somethings that come but once a year.
Christmas? Good. That suggests Clown. I have it.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="stagedirection">Fifty times the Clown has grinned and tumbled.</span></p>

<p>No. That won’t do. It’s too shoppy, stagey. Has a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupçon</i> of the <cite>Promise of May</cite> about it. Wants something
wider Ha! The Row, suggesting the Season, of course.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="stagedirection">Fifty times the Row has filled and emptied.</span></p>

<p>No. Don’t like it. Reads as if I was talking of a cistern.
Too heavy. Try something lighter. Pastry? Feathers?
Flowers? Ha! <em>that’s</em> it. Flowers, of course. Here, I’ve
got it!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="stagedirection">Fifty times the Rose has flowered and faded.</span></p>

<p>Anyhow, <em>that</em>’ll do to go off with. Let’s see. I want
fifty something elses to follow it up with. What shall it be?
Cartloads? Handfuls? Armfuls? Autumns? Harvests?
Good again. Not that there’s any precise connection between
them; but one must stick down something, How’ll this do?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="stagedirection">Fifty times the golden harvest fallen.</span></p>

<p class="unindent">Yes, that reads all right. Is there any other way of putting
“fifty?” Yes, “twice twenty-five.” But that won’t come in.
Then there’s “four times twelve and a half.” No; that
<a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a><span class="pageno">144</span>
won’t do. Enough “fifty.” <em>Now</em> we want some allusion
to Her Majesty. Must get in a “since.” I have it,
“Since our Queen assumed,” Capital. Here you are!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="decoration">Since our Queen assumed the globe, the sceptre.</span></p>

<p class="unindent">Come; that’s a beginning anyhow. Three lines! But
they’ve quite dried me up. Besides, I can’t go on in blank
verse like this. Don’t feel up to it. Must try another
metre. What metre. And then what on earth am I to
say in it? I haven’t had such a job as this for a long
time. Could weep over it. A precious Ode I shall make
of it.</p>

asking him to <cite>Shape a stately memorial</cite>, <cite>Make it regularly&mdash;no,

<p>On <a href="#Page_93">page 93</a> a parody of the above song, entitled <cite>The
Fine Old Standard Tragedy</cite>, was inserted, with a note stating
that it had first appeared in Albert Smith’s <cite>Town and
Country Miscellany</cite>. The author of the parody, the <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr>
E. Bradley, has written to point out that it was originally
published in <cite>The Month</cite> for October, 1851, a small magazine
edited by Albert Smith, and illustrated by John Leech.
<cite>The Month</cite> only ran to six numbers, from July to December,
1851, when it was discontinued. Bradbury and Evans,
the publishers, had lost money by it, and the fact was, as
stated by poor Albert Smith, <cite>The Month</cite> was far too good
for the public taste of that day. Mr. Bradley kindly sends
another parody, of the same original, which was very
popular amongst University men about 1845; the author’s
name is not known.</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><span class="sc">The Fine Young English Gentleman.</span></div>
<div class="i1">I’ll sing you a fine new song, ’twas made by a mad young pate,</div>
<div class="i1">Of a fine young English gentleman, who lives on no estate,</div>
<div class="i1">But who keeps up appearances at a very dashing rate,</div>
<div class="i1">And also his poor old landlady by coming home so late,</div>
<div class="i3">Like a fine young English gentleman, one of the present time.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He lives in a smart new lodging up a rather narrow stair,</div>
<div class="i1">And the furniture is fine enough, though a little the worse for wear,</div>
<div class="i1">For, two or three gay young friends of his are fond of smoking there,</div>
<div class="i1">And though they spoil the new carpet, this brave young man don’t care;</div>
<div class="i3">For, he’s a fine young English gentleman, one of the present time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">His custom of an afternoon, if he’s anything of a swell,</div>
<div class="i1">Is to ride a friend’s horse in Hyde Park, and chat with some first-rate belle;</div>
<div class="i1">Or to dine with a few nice friends of his at the Clarendon Hotel,</div>
<a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a><span class="pageno">150</span>
<div class="i1">Upon capital good turtle soup, and champagne that’s iced so well;</div>
<div class="i3">Like a fine young English gentleman, one of the present time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And, as for the rest of the evening, why I really cannot say,</div>
<div class="i1">Except that the cold punch was excellent, and the company very gay;</div>
<div class="i1">And he challenged two or three men; but then, they settle it next day;</div>
<div class="i1">And he does not quite remember how, or when he came away;</div>
<div class="i3">For, he’s a fine young English gentleman, one of the present time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, instead of being seen next day at his desk at half past ten,</div>
<div class="i1">He doesn’t find himself there till one, p’raps not even then;</div>
<div class="i1">And his head aches so, and his hand shakes so, he can scarcely hold his pen;</div>
<div class="i1">But, “these little accidents will occur to the steadiest of men!”</div>
<div class="i3">Says this fine young English gentleman, one of the present time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, the senior clerk is a horrid old man, as strict as he is sly,</div>
<div class="i1">And he calls up this fine young gentleman, and he asks him the reason why;</div>
<div class="i1">And this good young man replies to him&mdash;for, he “scorns to tell a lie”&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That he sat up all night with a poor sick friend, to the best of his memory!</div>
<div class="i3">Like a fine young English gentleman, one of the present time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then he goes back to his brother clerks, if nothing else intervenes.</div>
<div class="i1">And they’re neither quite as wise as judges, nor yet as grave as deans;</div>
<div class="i1">And a great deal is said about “flaring up,” and “going it like bricks and beans;”</div>
<div class="i1">And they call each other “slap up trumps!” I’m told the expression means</div>
<div class="i3">A fine young English gentleman, one of the present time.</div>

<div class="i1">I’ll sing you a song, a good old song, which I have sung before,</div>

<div class="i1">The bush then served him for a sign, with chequers at the door,</div>
<div class="i1">His ale was fine, and choice his wine, of which he had good store,</div>

<div class="i1">Upon the hearth the fire then blaz’d with logs and roots of trees,</div>

<div class="i1">No tax on house or windows then, on spirits, or on tea.</div>

<div class="i1">And sought the cottage door more oft than the mansion of the great,</div>
<div class="i2">Like a good old English Vicar, one of the olden time!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He never made himself the priest of an exclusive creed;</div>
<div class="i1">His house was ever open wide to all that were in need;</div>
<div class="i1">And ’twas his joy to cheer the sick, the hungry one to feed;</div>
<div class="i1">And little children by the hand with loving care to lead;</div>
<div class="i2">Like a good old English Vicar, one of the olden time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He did not social honour seek, or church preferment crave,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor did he let base lucre’s love his kindly soul deprave,</div>

<div class="i2">Of this good old English Vicar, one of the olden time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But look at his successor now, a change most marked you’ll see.</div>
<div class="i1">He is a very learned man who’s gained a high degree,</div>
<div class="i1">And who, expecting in due course that he’ll a bishop be,</div>
<div class="i1">Cares little for the humble folks who crave his ministry,</div>
<div class="i2">Like a learned modern Vicar, one of the present time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Shut in his study he essays some treatise to complete,</div>
<div class="i1">And rarely do you see his form about the village street;</div>
<div class="i1">His voice is never heard, alas! the toiling hind to greet,</div>
<div class="i1">And at the bedside of the poor you never, never meet</div>
<div class="i2">This learned, modern Vicar, one of the present time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But even he is better than his neighbour, who, we find</div>
<div class="i1">Forgetting that his Master was all merciful and kind!</div>
<div class="i1">And who when ’mongst the magistrates he proudly sits enshrined,</div>
<div class="i1">To stern and harsh severity’s persistently inclined,</div>
<div class="i2">Like a modern J.P. Vicar, one of the present time.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">He preaches charity, and bids all men forgive their foes,</div>
<div class="i1">And yet, when on the bench next day, no sign of mercy shows;</div>
<div class="i1">But far beyond the lay J.P.’s most eagerly he goes,</div>
<div class="i1">To crushing sentences inflict, and cruel fines impose;</div>
<div class="i2">Like a modern J.P. Vicar, one of the present time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">The parish next to his as priest an Honourable can claim,</div>
<div class="i1">Who that fat living holds because he bears his father’s name;</div>
<div class="i1">And who, the simple truth to tell, a clergyman became,</div>
<div class="i1">Because too mentally obtuse to otherwise win fame;</div>
<div class="i2">Like the high-born modern Vicar, one of the present time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Lawn-tennis is the only thing on which he seems intent,</div>
<div class="i1">And he each week for half-a-crown from town has sermons sent&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">That is, when at the vicarage, a rather rare event,</div>
<div class="i1">For at his father’s London house his time is mostly spent,</div>

<div class="i1">Just now, these very varied types at least in this agree:</div>
<div class="i1">They think their snug emoluments in jeopardy may be;</div>
<div class="i1">And rushing to the danger meet, which though far off they see,</div>
<div class="i1">They make their long-neglected flocks the pretext for their plea,</div>
<div class="i2">Like self-interested Vicars, all of the present time!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Be they Broad Church, or be they High, or Narrow they, or Low,</div>
<div class="i1">They all unite to hold their own against the common foe;</div>

<p>The music for this amusing song was arranged by Mr.

Edmund Forman, and it is published by Francis Bros. and
Day, of Oxford Street, London.</p>

<p>“Two Lovely Black Eyes” created such a furore at the
Trocadero Music Hall (formerly the Argyll Rooms) that it
was christened “The Trocadero Anthem,” and on February
8, 1887, <cite>The Pall Mall Gazette</cite> gave an account of the wild
enthusiasm with which the singer was nightly received, and
reported the following remarks, made by Mr. Coborn, as to
the origin of the song.</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="sc">Oh, what a Surprise</span>!”</p>

<p>“It was a fluke; in fact, I may say ‘a surprise.’ Such
things generally are. ‘Two Lovely Black Eyes’ is a parody
of an American song of which the chorus is ‘Nellie’s Lovely
Blue Eyes.’ The air is the same, and had been sung in
London by some lady vocalists, even at the Trocadero, long
before I thought of it. I had an engagement at the Paragon
in the Mile-end Road, and had to sing a new song one
Saturday night. That was a Tuesday, I think. I hummed
‘Nellie’s Blue Eyes,’ and thought the tune would catch them;
but I doubted about the ‘blue’ eyes. I thought they would
appreciate ‘black’ more. So I get my chorus&mdash;’Two
Lovely Black Eyes.’ That is always my starting point. I
had now to find my words. I was walking down Bethnal
Green, thinking about it; the elections were on at the time,
and I turned it over. So I got the first line:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">‘Strolling so happy down Bethnal Green,’</p>

<p class="unindent">Who? Why,</p>

<p class="center">‘This gay youth you might have seen,’</p>

<p class="unindent">You see, ‘seen,’ ‘green?’ Then you would naturally meet
some one. I met Tompkins. I wanted a word to rhime with
‘seen’ and ‘green,’ so I gave Tompkins a young lady:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">‘Tompkins and I with his girl between.”</p>

<p class="unindent">I had written ‘Harry’ at first, but it was too prosaic, so I
changed it to Tompkins, which sounded funnier. Then I
thought of the elections, and the rest followed easily. What
more natural than that we should fall out, and that Tompkins
should hand me ‘two lovely black eyes’? That is how
it grew. Here is the original which I wrote coming home in
the train.” And Mr. Coborn produced a little black-covered
note-book, every page of which was covered with writing.
Songs and scraps of dialogue and bits of street conversation
which Mr. Coborn will introduce into his patter. “I have
sung it about one thousand times in English, French, and
German,” and the popular comic gave me some samples. He
is not a polyglottist, but he has a quick ear, and his accent
is pronounced to be marvellous. Here are the French and
German renderings:&mdash;</p>

<p class="unindent">“I propose to sing it in Hebrew and modern Greek. But
the song has been a fluke right through its career. I thought
it would suit the Paragon audiences (we must consider our
public). I thought they would like the chorus. But when I
came to the ‘Trocadero’ I was a little doubtful, thinking it
might be too coarse. So I asked the conductor, and if he
had said ‘yes’ I should have changed it at once. It is my
principle rather to sacrifice a laugh, than to offend a
prejudice.”</p>

<div class="poemtitle"><cite>Parody of a well-known Salvation Army Song.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">Now I have been a warm ’un in my time,</div>
<div class="i2">I have drank and been in rows by the score,</div>
<div class="i1">But now I’ve given it up and signed the pledge,</div>
<div class="i2">And vowed that I would do so never more.</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis true that I have joined a goodly crew,</div>
<div class="i2">That never, hardly ever, say sware;</div>
<div class="i1">The dark half-hours are nice, I’ve been in them once or twice,</div>
<div class="i2">So I know what it is to be there.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When first I saw this very happy band,</div>
<div class="i2">They were singing hymns and preaching in the street,</div>
<div class="i1">A lady came and shook me by the hand,</div>
<div class="i2">And whispered words of piety so sweet;</div>
<div class="i1">I squeezed her little fingers rather tight,</div>
<div class="i2">And tried to kiss her lovely face so fair,</div>
<div class="i1">But she said, if you will come to our sweet Salvation home,</div>
<div class="i2">You will know what it is to be there.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>Chorus.</cite>)&mdash;To be there, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="i1">I very soon began to preach and prate,</div>
<div class="i2">And with the sisters played some funny pranks,</div>
<div class="i1">I was so good at nobbing with the plate,</div>
<div class="i2">They soon made me a Captain of the ranks;</div>
<div class="i1">And often when our meetings were dispersed,</div>
<div class="i2">With Sister Jane I’d offer up a prayer,</div>
<div class="i1">I’d such a jolly spree, when she took me home to tea,</div>
<div class="i2">For I knew what it was to be there.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>Chorus.</cite>)&mdash;To be there, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="i1">I’m troubled with a vixen for a wife,</div>
<div class="i2">And often sigh for liberty once more,</div>
<div class="i1">She leads me such a very wretched life,</div>
<div class="i2">And with the poker warms me on the floor;</div>
<a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a><span class="pageno">155</span>
<div class="i1">She summoned me before the beak one day,</div>
<div class="i2">Who said I’d used her shamefully unfair,</div>
<div class="i1">Then he ordered me a spell, at the jail in Clerkenwell,</div>
<div class="i2">So I know what it is to be there!</div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>Chorus.</cite>)&mdash;To be there, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><cite>Encore Verses.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">I’m a most unlucky man, I am, indeed,</div>
<div class="i2">Misfortune’s cup I’ve emptied to the dregs,</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve tried my best, but find I can’t <em>succeed</em>,</div>
<div class="i2">And so at last I took to sucking eggs;</div>
<div class="i1">My uncle in the best friend that I’ve got,</div>
<div class="i2">He keeps a pawnshop close to Leicester Square,</div>
<div class="i1">And sometimes I drop in, when I’m rather short of tin,</div>
<div class="i2">For I know what it is to be there!</div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>Chorus.</cite>)&mdash;To be there, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="i1">To Epsom I went down one Derby day,</div>
<div class="i2">And thought that I should have a jolly spree,</div>
<div class="i1">When a fellow came and wanted me to pay,</div>
<div class="i2">He said he backed the winning horse with me;</div>
<div class="i1">I told him I had never made a bet,</div>
<div class="i2">When a crowd got round and soon began to swear,</div>
<div class="i1">And when they tore my clothes, blacked my eyes, and broke my nose,</div>
<div class="i2">Oh, I knew what it was to be there!</div>

<div class="poemtitle"><cite>A Parody of Jack’s Yarn.</cite></div>
<div class="i1">’Twas on a Monday morn, and the Tailor played the horn,</div>
<div class="i2">On which he’d been a blowing all the way;</div>
<div class="i1">He was sitting on a van, and out on the randan,</div>
<div class="i2">A going to Rye House to spend the day.</div>
<div class="i1">For a few hours free from strife, ’cos he’d got a nagging wife,</div>
<div class="i2">But his plan to keep it quiet was in vain,</div>
<div class="i1">For a pal just for a game, went and told the Tailor’s dame,</div>
<div class="i2">So she took her eighteenpenn’orth down by train.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i5">Singing, Hilly holly ho, listen to my tale of woe,</div>
<div class="i6">Of this Tailor’s dinner anniversary,</div>
<div class="i5">When every jolly snip, was enjoying of his trip,</div>
<div class="i6">Singing, Hilly holly hilly holly ho!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">When the Tailor ceased to play, he was looking far from gay.</div>
<div class="i2">He showed us where his face and neck were scored;</div>
<div class="i1">When we got to the Rye, the first thing we did spy,</div>
<div class="i2">Was his wife, and Holy Moses, how she jawed!</div>
<div class="i1">And then it was such fun, for to see the Tailor run,</div>
<div class="i2">Round the river bank, she in pursuit of he;</div>
<div class="i1">’Till at length she tripped and fell, in the water with a yell,</div>
<div class="i2">I reckon you’d a heard across the Lea.</div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>Chorus.</cite>)&mdash;Singing, &amp;c.</div>
<div class="i1">Every man to this day brags, how long it took to find the drags,</div>
<div class="i2">Tho’ they hung near, and handy on a tree,</div>
<div class="i1">The drags not being found, of course the old girl drowned,</div>
<div class="i2">And so the poor old snip was free.</div>
<div class="i1">So here’s good luck and life, to the man what drowned his wife,</div>
<div class="i2">And so saved the heavy undertaker’s fee.</div>
<div class="i1">All the dragging was in vain, she ne’er was seen again,</div>
<div class="i2">That’s why there’s good eel fishing in the Lea.</div>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">I sing a doleful tragedy,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">Guy Fawkes, the prince of sinisters,</div>
<div class="i1">Who once blew up the House of Lords,</div>
<div class="i2">The King, and all his Ministers;</div>
<div class="i1">That is, he would have blown them up,</div>
<div class="i2">(And folks will ne’er forget him,)</div>
<div class="i1">His will was good to do the deed,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">That is, if they’d have let him!</div>
<div class="poemdivider">  Tow, row, row! tol di ridy, tol di ridy, tow, row, row!</div>
<div class="i1">He straightway came from Lambeth side,</div>
<div class="i2">And wished the State was undone,</div>
<div class="i1">And crossing over Vauxhall Bridge,</div>
<div class="i2">That way came into London:</div>
<div class="i1">That is, he would have come that way,</div>
<div class="i2">To perpetrate his guilt, sirs,</div>
<div class="i1">But a little thing prevented him&mdash;the bridge it wasn’t built, sirs!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then sneaking through the dreary vault,</div>
<div class="i2">With portable gas light, sirs,</div>
<div class="i1">About to touch the powder train</div>
<div class="i2">At witching hour of night, sirs;</div>
<div class="i1">That is, I mean, he would have used</div>
<div class="i2">The gas, but was prevented,</div>
<div class="i1">’Cause gas, you see, in James’s time,</div>
<div class="i2">It had not been invented!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, James, you know, was always thought</div>
<div class="i2">To be a very sly fox,</div>
<div class="i1">So, he bid ’em search th’ aforesaid vault,</div>
<div class="i2">And there they found poor Guy Fawkes;</div>
<div class="i1">For that he meant to blow them up,</div>
<div class="i2">I think there’s little doubt, sirs,</div>
<div class="i1">That is, I mean, provided he</div>
<div class="i2">Had not been found out, sirs.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And when they caught him in the fact,</div>
<div class="i2">So very near the Crown’s end,</div>
<div class="i1">They straightway sent to Bow Street,</div>
<div class="i2">For that brave old runner, Townsend;</div>
<div class="i1">That is, they would have sent for him,</div>
<div class="i2">For fear he was no starter at,</div>
<div class="i1">But Townsend wasn’t living then&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">He wasn’t born till after that!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So then they put poor Guy to death,</div>
<div class="i2">For ages to remember,</div>
<div class="i1">And boys now kill him once a year</div>
<div class="i2">In dreary dark November;</div>
<div class="i1">That is, I mean his effigy,</div>
<div class="i2">For truth is strong and steady,</div>
<div class="i1">Poor Guy, they cannot kill again,</div>
<div class="i2">Because he’s dead already!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then bless her gracious Majesty</div>
<div class="i2">And bless her royal son, sirs,</div>
<div class="i1">And may he never get blown up</div>
<div class="i2">(That is, if she gets one, sirs)</div>
<a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a><span class="pageno">156</span>
<div class="i1">And if she does, I’m sure he’ll reign,</div>
<div class="i2">So prophecies my song, sirs,</div>

<div class="i2">And so I can’t be wrong, sirs!</div>

<div class="i1">In the story of “Aladdin,” sir, that veritable history,</div>
<div class="i1">A certain downy dodger of a new Light made a mystery;</div>
<div class="i1">And all for Peoples good, of course, his words were very bold ones.</div>
<div class="i1">The cry he gulled the Public with, was “New lamps for Old ones.”</div>

<div class="i1">Now, it wasn’t out of love at all for darkness, poor humanity,</div>
<div class="i1">He offered them New Lamps for Old Ones, but only out of vanity;</div>
<div class="i1">That Arabian Mr. Cockrane, knew the value of the old one,</div>
<div class="i1">And he thought a sounding one of <em>brass</em> might bring him in a gold one.</div>
<div class="i6">Buy&mdash;Buy&mdash;Buy, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So, even in the present day, in almost every nation,</div>
<div class="i1">Designing knaves can profit by a “Brummagem” imitation,</div>
<div class="i1">They cry out “Change, good people, change,” around your dwellings hovering,</div>
<div class="i1">And many are so fond of <em>change</em>, they cannot keep a <em>Sovereign</em>.</div>
<div class="i6">Buy&mdash;Buy&mdash;Buy, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Here, Agitators bawl “Free Trade,” while others shout “Protection.”</div>
<div class="i1">“The Suffrage,” and every week a General Election;</div>
<div class="i1">With many other Party cries, my metaphors are bold ones,</div>
<div class="i1">But the principle is all the same, it’s “New Lamps for Old ones.”</div>
<div class="i6">Buy&mdash;Buy&mdash;Buy, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Conservatives “to the Country” cry out “New Lamps for Old Ones;”</div>
<div class="i1">They put the Whig small candles <em>out</em>, and introduced their mould ones;</div>
<div class="i1">But the blessed Lights in Downing Street don’t much improve the business,</div>

<div class="i1">The wily Pontiff said such a <em>mass</em> he wasn’t used to;</div>
<div class="i1">He “stepped it,” and their New Lamp for awhile flared up quite glittering,</div>
<div class="i1">But the French soon put it out, and the Pope’s old Lantern lit again.</div>
<div class="i6">Buy&mdash;Buy&mdash;Buy, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">About Australian “Diggins” Agitators they keep crying,</div>

<div class="i1">In a country which you all know well, close to the one that we’re in,</div>

<div class="i1">They bought the Lamp up eagerly, from men so much distinguished.</div>
<div class="i1">But it only kept alight a week, and then it was extinguished.</div>
<div class="i6">Buy&mdash;Buy&mdash;Buy, &amp;c.</div>

<div class="i1">And die away, till in the dark, you find you’re but a sold one?</div>
<div class="i1">So unless you’re sure it’s a better one, why, never change the old one.</div>

<div class="i1">Good things abounded on all sides, and every kind of wine was there,</div>

<div class="i1">They look’d up at the bright blue sky, and said, “The weather’s splendid!”</div>
<div class="i1">That is, they would have said so, but&mdash;to use a vulgar name, sir&mdash;</div>

<p>“The Vicar of Bray, in Berkshire,” says D’Israeli, in
his “Curiosities of Literature,” was a Papist under the
reign of Henry the Eighth, and a Protestant under Edward
the Sixth. He was a Papist again under Mary, and once
more became a Protestant in the reign of Elizabeth. When
reproached for his versatility of religious creeds, and taxed
with being a turn-coat, and an inconstant changeling, as
Fuller expresses it, he replied: “Not so, neither; for if I
changed my religion, I am sure I kept true to my principle,
which is to live and die the Vicar of Bray.”</p>

<p>In a note in Nichols’ <cite>Select Poems</cite>, 1782, vol. viii., p. 234,
it is stated that <cite>The song of the Vicar of Bray</cite> “is said to have
been written by an officer in Colonel Fuller’s regiment, in
the reign of King George the First. It is founded on an
historical fact; and though it reflects no great honour on the
hero of the poem, is humourously expressive of the complexion
of the times, in the successive reigns from Charles
the Second to George the First.</p>

<p>As to the name of this famous Vicar there are several
theories. According to one authority, “Pendleton, the
<em>celebrated</em> Vicar of Bray,” became rector of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s,
Walbrook, in the City of London, in the reign of Edward
<abbr title="Six">VI.</abbr> But in a letter from Mr. Brome, to Mr. Rawlins, dated
June 14, 1735, he says, “I have had a long chase after the
Vicar of Bray. Dr. Fuller, in his <cite>Worthies</cite>, takes no notice
of him, I suppose he knew not his name. I am informed it
was <cite>Simon Alleyn</cite> or <cite>Allen</cite>, who was Vicar of Bray about
1540, and died 1588, so was Vicar of Bray nearly fifty years.
You now partake of the sport that has cost me some pains
to take.”</p>

<p>Camden, in his <cite>Britannia</cite>, says of Alleyn: “This is he of
whom is the proverb, ‘The Vicar of Bray still.’” The song
however, refers to an entirely different period, commencing
in the reign of Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and lasting until “the illustrious
House of Hanover.” There was a Vicar of Bray, unknown
to fame, who was vicar during the exact period covered by
the song. His tombstone is in the centre aisle of Bray
Church, and its record is that his name was Francis Carswell,
that he was chaplain to Charles <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> and James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>,
Rector of Remenham and Vicar of Bray forty-two years, and
that he died in 1709.</p>

<div class="i6">Oh! most confoundedly.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Now, little Queen Cole had a musical soul,</div>

<div class="i1">But, the third one, to wit, she said could not sing a bit,</div>
<div class="i2">’Cause his name didn’t end in “I.”</div>
<div class="i1">Some fellow from town, some Jones or Brown;</div>

<div class="i1">This was all very well, but I must also tell</div>

<div class="i1">Well, little Queen Cole, as time did roll,</div>

<div class="i1">So that Old King Cole felt anxious in his soul,</div>
<div class="i2">And with a deep sigh said he,</div>

<div class="i6">“For to fill, &amp;c.”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But little Queen Cole was as coaxing a little soul,</div>
<div class="i2">As you’d find on a summer’s day;</div>
<div class="i1">So said she, “If I axes, now I know they’ll pay the taxes.”</div>
<div class="i2">“We’ll be smother’d if we do!” said they.</div>
<div class="i1">“For ve werry much winces at this long list of princes,</div>
<div class="i2">Vich is longer than it ought for to be!”</div>
<div class="i1">But the Queen, too proud to wrangle, oh! she set up a mangle,</div>
<div class="i2">And her subjects they went tax free.</div>
<div class="i6">And her subjects, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">But the people grew ashamed, when they heard the story named,</div>
<div class="i2">How she mangled for the whole family;</div>
<div class="i1">So they swore “Blood and ’ounds,” and they fumbled out the “browns,”</div>
<div class="i2">Just in time for their old country.</div>
<div class="i1">For a very old foe saw the royal coffer low,</div>
<div class="i2">And a very fierce attack made he;</div>
<div class="i1">And it would have served them right (they were shabby fellows quite),</div>
<div class="i2">If he’d gain’d the victory.</div>
<div class="i6">If he’d gained, &amp;c.</div>

<p>This mellifluous piece of nonsense was published in the
<cite>Miscellanies</cite> of Alexander Pope, but it was also inserted
amongst the poems of Dean Swift, where it was entitled <cite>A
Love Song in Modern Taste</cite>. It ridiculed an affected style of
poetry then much in vogue, and which continued in fashion
for many years, culminating in the writings of a clique,
known as the <cite>Della Cruscans</cite>, which was originated by a few
English, of both sexes, assembled at Florence in 1785. They
were named <cite>Della Cruscans</cite> because their leader, one Robert
Merry, signed his trashy effusions as a member of the
Acadamy Della Crusca at Florence. Merry wrote a tragedy,
entitled <cite>Lorenzo</cite>, which was more successful than many
comedies, for it made the audience laugh immoderately,
besides innumerable poems long since forgotten. By a
deliberate system of mutual puffing the Della Cruscans forced
their absurd productions upon the public, and in the early
years of the present century nearly every journal contained
some of their poems, published over assumed names, such as
Laura Maria, Edwin, Anna Matilda, &amp;c. These were afterwards
gathered into volumes, with a few poems by really
able writers such as M. G. Lewis, Robert Southey, and
S. T. Coleridge, and published by subscription.</p>

<p>There is no knowing how long this twaddle might have
held the public taste had not William Gifford (Editor of the
Quarterly Review) produced his famous satires <cite>The Baviad</cite>,
and <cite>The Maeviad</cite>, in which he mercilessly exposed the inflated
nonsense written by the Della Cruscans; and by well chosen
extracts from their poems turned the laugh so completely
against them that they slunk back into their native obscurity.</p>

<p>Gifford’s satires are still read with pleasure, and the extracts
given in the notes show that Pope’s nonsense verses were
excelled by the would-be-serious Della Cruscans; as for
example&mdash;</p>

<p>When the brothers Smith projected their famous <cite>Rejected
Addresses</cite> they included an imitation of the Della Cruscan
poetry, entitled Drury’s Dirge, of which Lord Jeffery wrote
“The verses are very smooth and very nonsensical&mdash;as was
intended; but they are not so good as Swift’s celebrated
song by a Person of Quality; and are so exactly in the same
measure, and on the same plan, that it is impossible to avoid
making the comparison.”</p>

<p>Charles Louis, King of Bavaria, caused great dissatisfaction
in his dominions by his reckless extravagance, and his
utter incapacity to fulfil the duties of his position. He
formed a disgraceful <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">liaison</i> with a scheming adventuress
generally known under the assumed name of <cite>Lola Montes</cite>,
but whom he created Countess Von Landfeldt. At length
the interference of Lola Montes in state affairs became too
notorious, and she was banished the Kingdom. She afterwards
led a wandering life, delivered some lectures in London
in 1859, thence proceeding to the United States. She died
in New York, January 17, 1861. Charles Louis was compelled
to abdicate in March, 1848, but survived his fall for
twenty years, living to see the throne occupied by his grandson,
Louis <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>, the Mad King and patron of Wagner, who recently

<p>Sir John Suckling also wrote what is,
perhaps, the finest ballad in the English language,
<cite>A Ballad upon a Wedding</cite>, this appears
to have escaped parody. An imitation of it,
however, is contained in <cite>Elegant Extracts from
the British Poets</cite>, 1824. It is entitled <cite>Aylesbury
Races</cite>, and is attributed to Sir J. H. Moore;
it is very long, and does not sufficiently follow

<p>This parody refers to the most extraordinary series of
disturbances, known as the O.P. Riots, which took place
in the new Covent Garden Theatre, commencing on the
opening night, September 18, 1809, and lasting, almost
without intermission, till December 16, when the old
charges were restored. John Philip Kemble, the tragedian,
and manager of the theatre, was singled out for
special disapproval, the outcries against the <em>Cat</em> (Madame
Catalani) were also very bitter, as it was generally supposed
the prices had been raised owing to her exorbitant
salary. Madame Catalani’s business agent used to ask
five hundred guineas for her appearance at a concert,
which was considered an enormous sum in those days.</p>

<p>Kemble (styled <em>Black Jack</em>, on account of his dark complexion
and black hair), had a pedantic way of pronouncing
<em>ache</em> as <em>aitche</em>.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">LORD BATEMAN.</p>

<p>One of the best known of our old Ballads is <cite>Lord Beichan</cite>,
or <cite>Buchan</cite>. This is corrupted in the modern English form
to <cite>Lord Bateman</cite>; the ballad commences thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">“Lord Bateman was a noble lord,</div>

<div class="i2">He longed strange countries for to see.”</div>
</div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>Cruikshank collectors will remember that the artist
chose this ballad for illustrating, and small as is the book,
a copy of the original 1839 edition sold for £5 15s. at
Sotherby’s last year. Of course Cruikshank’s version is
comic, and the history of it is that he sang the ballad at a
dinner of the Antiquarian society, to the air, and with the
cockney pronunciation he had heard given to it by a street
ballad singer. Dickens was present at the dinner, and
offered to supply the illustrative notes (which are exceedingly
humorous), Cruikshank etched the plates, and almost
innumerable editions of the little book have been published;
the most recent having been issued a few years
since by Messrs. Bell and Daldy, London.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">LILLI BURLERO.</p>

<p>This song, now all but forgotten, deserves to be recorded,
for it contributed not a little to the Revolution of 1688. A
contemporary writer said of it, “A foolish ballad was made at
that time, treating the Papists, and chiefly the Irish, in a
very ridiculous manner, which had a burden, said to be Irish
words, “Lero, lero, liliburlero,” that made an impression
on the King’s army that cannot be imagined by those that
saw it not. The whole army, and at last the people, were
singing it perpetually, and perhaps never had so slight a
thing so great an effect.”</p>

<p>One of the principal tools of James <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr> was General
Richard Talbot, who was nominated to the Lieutenancy of
Ireland in 1686, in this position his arbitrary and cruel treatment
of the Protestants recommended him to the favour of
his bigoted master, who rewarded him by creating him Earl
of Tyrconnel, and sending him a second time, and on this occasion
as Viceroy, to Ireland. It was at this time that <cite>Lilliburlero</cite>
was written; <cite>Lilliburlero</cite> and <cite>Bullen-a-lah</cite> are said to
have been the sign and countersign used among the Irish
papists during their warfare with the protestants.</p>

<p>The song has been ascribed to Lord Dorset, but also, and
with more probability, to Lord Wharton, who openly boasted
that he had sung King James out of three kingdoms.</p>

<p>And Lord Macaulay wrote of <cite>Lilliburlero</cite>:&mdash;“The verses
and the tune caught the fancy of the nation. It was especially
the delight of the English army.” Whilst Sterne also mentions
it in “Tristram Shandy,” as the favourite air of
Uncle Toby, who had been a soldier in the army of
William <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></p>

<p>The following imitation alludes to the attempts being
made in 1798 to bring about the legislative union of England
and Ireland, but which did not actually take place until
1801. At that date the Irish Parliament was induced, by
bribery and fraud to consent to its incorporation with that of
Great Britain. The parody is a somewhat remarkable prophecy
of what has actually occurred.</p>

<p>The style of the old ballad has been often so successfully
imitated as to deceive even the most accomplished literary
critics. Amongst these may be noted the “New-Old
Ballads,” written by Peter Pindar (Dr. Wolcot) which were
republished by that clever but unscrupulous satirist in a collection,
entitled <cite>Tears and Smiles</cite>, published in 1801, with the
following “Advertisement to the Reader. These ballads
were composed several years ago, in imitation of authors
of the reigns of Harry the Eighth, Elizabeth, and James,
and sent to some of my literary friends as innocent deceptions.&mdash;P.
P.”</p>

<p>There were also “The Cornish Ballads,” written by Mrs.
Gervis, and “The Bristow Tragedy, or Death of Sir Charles
Bawdin,” by Thomas Chatterton, and others too numerous
to mention, especially as they cannot exactly be styled
<cite>Parodies</cite> in the strict sense of the term.</p>

<p>The finest burlesque ballad in the language is undoubtedly
that entitled “The Queen in France,” contained in
<cite>The Book of Ballads</cite> edited by Bon Gaultier, and published
by W. Blackwood and Sons. This clever book of parodies

and burlesques was the joint production of Sir Theodore
Martin, and the late Professor W. E. Aytoun. The burlesque
ballad in question was probably composed by
Aytoun, it describes the Queen’s visit to Louis Phillippe
in France in 1843, and closely imitates the metre and
diction of “Sir Patrick Spens” an old Scotch ballad.
The old ballad may be found in Percy’s <cite>Reliques</cite>, in Sir
Walter Scott’s <cite>Border Minstrelsy</cite>, and in <cite>Early Ballads</cite>,
edited by Robert Bell. “<cite>The Queen in France</cite>” is very long,
and disjointed extracts would give but a faint idea of its
quaint humour, and simple pathos, besides which <cite>The Bon
Gaultier Ballads</cite> is a readily accessible book.</p>

<p>In the same volume there is another, but inferior, burlesque
ballad, entitled <cite>Little John and the Red Friar</cite>, which
deals with the vexed question of ecclesiastical titles. Little
John representing Lord John Russell, and the Red Friar,
Cardinal Wiseman, who, in 1850, was appointed by the
Pope, Lord Archbishop of Westminster, a nomination
which gave rise to much agitation and angry controversy.</p>

<p>During the O.P. riots at Covent Garden Theatre, in 1809,
a certain Mr. Henry Clifford was a very conspicuous opponent
to the new prices as fixed by John Kemble. Finally the
management of the Theatre had to concede nearly all the
claims advanced by the O.P. party through their spokesman,
Clifford, and the victory was celebrated in the following
lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Hal Clifford would once a reforming go,</div>
<div class="i2">Heigho! says Clifford;</div>

<div class="i2">“I’ll do it” roar’d patriot Clifford.</div>

<p>The last lines refer to the Dinner of Reconciliation which
took place at the Crown and Anchor Tavern on January 4th,
1810, when Mr. Clifford took the chair, supported by the
most prominent of the O. P. party, and Messrs. John
Kemble and Harris represented the management of Covent
Garden Theatre. For full details of these extraordinary
proceedings the reader is referred to the <cite>Covent Garden

<h3 class="h3head">RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN.</h3>

<p class="center">Born in Dublin in 1751. Died, July 7, 1816.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Lord Byron said, “Whatever Sheridan has done, has
been, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">par excellence</i>, always the best of its kind. He has
written the best comedy (“School for Scandal”), the best
drama (“The Duenna”), the best farce (“The Critic”), and
the best address (“Monologue on Garrick”); and, to crown
all, delivered, the very best oration (the famous Begum
Speech) ever conceived, or heard in this country.”</p>

<p>In addition to The School for Scandal, The Duenna, and
The Critic, Sheridan wrote <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Patrick’s Day, a farce; The
Rivals, a comedy; A Trip to Scarborough (partly adapted
from Sir J. Vanbrugh’s “Relapse,”) and Pizarro, a tragedy.</p>

<p>Sheridan was indebted to an old play written by the Duke
of Buckingham and entitled “The Rehearsal” (1672), for the
main idea of “The Critic,” but all the personal allusions
in Sheridan’s farce were made to well known contemporary
characters. “The Critic” was produced at Drury Lane
Theatre in 1779. In 1780 a miserable anonymous imitation
was published by H. Kingsbury, entitled “The Critick;
or, a Tragedy Rehearsed, a Literary Catchpenny! Prelude
to a Dramatic after-piece, by R. B. Sheridan, <abbr title="Esquire">Esq.</abbr>, with a
Dedication, Preface, and Prologue.” This does not appear
to have been intended for the stage. Another imitation
was entitled “The Critic Anticipated; or, the Humours of
the Green Room, as rehearsed behind the curtain of the
theatre in Drury Lane, 1779.”</p>

<p>Coming to modern times, Mr. F. C. Burnand founded an
amusing burlesque upon the tragedy portion of “The
Critic.” This was entitled “Elizabeth; or, The Invisible
Armada,” and was published in 1870, by Tinsley Brothers,
London. The favourite old characters Tilburina, Don
Ferolo Whiskerandos, and the Governor of Tilbury Fort
are here introduced; no mention is made in the printed
copy as to whether this burlesque was ever performed at any
theatre.</p>

<p>In 1884 Sheridan’s comedy, “The Rivals,” was being
played at the Haymarket Theatre (London), with a most
elaborate <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-scene</i>, and, perhaps, a little too much display
of antiquarian accuracy in details, to ridicule which an afterpiece,
entitled “The Ar-Rivals, or a Trip to Margate,” was
produced at the Avenue Theatre on June 24, 1884. It was
announced as having been written by “J. M. Banero and
A. D. Pincroft” (Pinero and Bancroft are almost too slyly
hidden here), and that it would be produced with “Real
sand buckets, real wooden spades, real periwinkles which
would be eaten with real pins, and, as far as practicable,
with real appetites.”</p>

<p>Yet notwithstanding all this wit, the travesty was pronounced
by the critics as utterly beneath criticism, and was
at once withdrawn.</p>

<p>Passing now from burlesques of Sheridan’s complete plays
to parodies of songs contained in them, the favourite appears
to be the drinking song which occurs in the third act of “The
School for Scandal.”</p>

<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="One">I.</abbr></div>
<div class="i5">I’ve a guinea I can spend,</div>
<div class="i5">I’ve a wife, and I’ve a friend,</div>
<div class="i1">And a troop of little children at my knee, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">I’ve a cottage of my own</div>
<div class="i5">With the ivy overgrown,</div>
<div class="i1">And a garden with a view of the sea, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">I can sit at my door</div>
<div class="i5">By my shady sycamore,</div>
<div class="i1">Large of heart, though of very small estate, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">So come and drain a glass</div>

<div class="i1">And I’ll tell you what I love and what I hate, John Brown.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr></div>
<div class="i5">I love the song of birds,</div>
<div class="i5">And the children’s early words,</div>
<div class="i1">And a loving woman’s voice, low and sweet, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">And I hate a false pretence,</div>
<div class="i5">And the want of common sense,</div>
<div class="i1">And arrogance, and fawning, and deceit, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">I love the meadow flowers,</div>
<div class="i5">And the brier in the bowers,</div>
<div class="i1">And I love an open face without guile, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">And I hate a selfish knave,</div>
<div class="i5">And a proud, contented slave,</div>
<div class="i1">And a lout who’d rather borrow than he’d toil, John Brown.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></div>
<div class="i5">I love a simple song</div>
<div class="i5">That awakes emotions strong,</div>
<div class="i1">And the word of hope that raises him who faints, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">And I hate the constant whine</div>
<div class="i5">Of the foolish who repine,</div>
<div class="i1">And turn their good to evil by complaints, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">But even when I hate,</div>
<div class="i5">If I seek my garden gate,</div>
<div class="i1">And survey the world around me and above, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">The hatred flies my mind,</div>
<div class="i5">And I sigh for humankind,</div>

<div class="i5">I never scorn my health,</div>
<div class="i5">Nor sell my soul for wealth,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor destroy one day the pleasures of the next, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">I’ve parted with my pride,</div>
<div class="i5">And I take the sunny side,</div>
<div class="i1">For I’ve found it worse than folly to be sad, John Brown;</div>
<div class="i5">I keep a conscience clear,</div>
<div class="i5">I’ve a hundred pounds a year,</div>

<div class="i1">I’ve listened to your song, and, unless I’m very wrong,</div>
<div class="i1">There is much in it of what we now call bosh&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">It is easy so to sing, but to <em>do</em>’s another thing,</div>
<div class="i1">And I fear that your philosophy won’t wash&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">Of course that’s not your name&mdash;but ’twill answer all the same</div>

<div class="i1">And offended you can’t be, as you’ve done the same to me,</div>
<div class="i1">For I’m no more John Brown than you’re Tom Smith&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">What you love and what you hate&mdash;you’re at liberty to state,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve nothing upon earth with that to do&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>

<div class="i1">And besides, I’ve much the same dislikes as you&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">It’s on matters of finance, in which there’s no romance,</div>
<div class="i1">I would break with you a lance&mdash;if you please, Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">I’m myself a family man, and I don’t believe you can</div>
<div class="i1">Contrive to live with yours on bread and cheese&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">You’ve “a hundred pounds a year”&mdash;well, let’s even say it’s clear</div>
<div class="i1">Of income-tax, that’s not two pounds a week&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">But the cottage is “your own,” so the rent must in be thrown,</div>
<div class="i1">Which I grant will help your income out to eke&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per contra</i>, you’ve a wife, as dear to you as life,&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">I hope she is, I’m sure, for both your sakes&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">But the more you hold her dear, the more must be your fear,</div>
<div class="i1">If anything your little income shakes&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Of children you’ve a troop&mdash;an interesting group,</div>
<div class="i1">But to tell how many form it you forgot&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">Say five or six in all, which for “a troop” is small.&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Of bread and butter they must eat a lot&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">Of their clothes you may be spare, but they cannot go <em>quite</em> bare,</div>
<div class="i1">And whooping-cough and measles you must count&mdash;Tom Smith,</div>
<div class="i1">And if only one be ill, I’m afraid the doctor’s bill</div>
<div class="i1">Might at Christmas prove a serious amount&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">’Tis philosophy, no doubt, trifles not to fret about,</div>
<div class="i1">And “sufficient for the day” is a fine text&mdash;Tom Smith;</div>
<div class="i1">But at your garden gate do you never scratch your pate,</div>
<div class="i1">When you think what’s in the cupboard for the <em>next</em>&mdash;Tom Smith?</div>
<div class="i1">The pot you know must boil; ’twould be better sure to toil,</div>
<div class="i1">And add by honest labour to your store&mdash;Tom Smith,</div>
<div class="i1">Than moon away your time, in philosophic rhyme,</div>
<div class="i1">Or sitting ’neath your shady sycamore&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">You bid me, as I pass, come and drain with you a glass,</div>
<div class="i1">But it cannot be of wine, or beer, or grog&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">It’s more like “Adam’s Ale,” I’m afraid, than “Bass’s Pale,”</div>
<div class="i1">And to drink, I water shun like a mad dog&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">If “a guinea you’ve to spend,” I advise you as a friend,</div>
<div class="i1">To put it in the Savings’ Bank forthwith&mdash;Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="i1">You will want it before long, and sing another song,</div>

<p>This song, which was one of a series entitled “Voices
from the Crowd,” originally appeared in the second number
of the <cite>Daily News</cite> (London).</p>

<p>Most of Dr. Charles Mackay’s songs breathe sentiments
of hope for the future of the people, and trust in their good
sense and ability to govern themselves. Such sentiments
were very unpopular forty years ago, when revolutions were
of frequent occurrence on the Continent, and Chartism was
dreaded in England. Hence Mackay’s verses were parodied
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">I met the waiter in his prime</div>
<div class="i2">At a magnificent hotel;</div>
<div class="i1">His hair untinged by care or time,</div>
<div class="i2">Was oiled and brushed exceeding well.</div>
<div class="i1">When “Waiter,” was the impatient cry,</div>
<div class="i2">In accents growing stronger,</div>

<div class="i1">Within a year we met once more,</div>
<div class="i2">’Twas in another part of town&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">An humbler air the waiter wore,</div>

<div class="i1">Still, when I shouted, “Waiter, bread!”</div>
<div class="i3">He came out rather stronger,</div>

<div class="i1">Time takes us on through many a grade;</div>

<div class="i1">I and the waiter met again</div>
<div class="i2">At a small inn at Ongar;</div>

<div class="i1">I’ve marked him now for many a year;</div>
<div class="i2">I’ve seen his coat more rusty grow;</div>
<div class="i1">His linen is less bright and clear;</div>
<div class="i2">His polished pumps are on the go.</div>
<div class="i1">Torn are, alas! his Berlin gloves&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">They used to be much stronger;</div>

<div class="i2">’Gainst want he wages feeble strife;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s at the bottom of the hill,</div>
<div class="i2">Downward has been his path through life.</div>
<div class="i1">Of “Waiter, waiter,” there are cries,</div>

<p>There was also a parody of this song in <cite>The Hornet</cite>, May
22, 1872, which is now quite out of date, and another appeared
in the <cite><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen’s Review</cite> for July 2, 1887. This prophesies
that there will be a “good time coming” when an eminent
politician goes to&mdash;&mdash;a certain warm but unmentionable
place&mdash;the good taste of which assertion might not be obvious
to some over sensitive people, so the parody is omitted.</p>

<p>Dr. Mackay wrote a number of other songs. “To the
West! To the West!” was very popular; it was imitated in
some verses entitled “I’m in Love! I’m in Love!”; whilst
“Far, far upon the sea” was parodied by J. A. Hardwick
as “Pa, out upon the spree,” in three very coarse and slangy
verses, which cannot have a place here.</p>

<div class="i1">I’ve lived since then upon “heavy wet,”</div>

<div class="i1">He shall find me over a cup of tea!</div>

<div class="i1">Like creatures in whose sunny veins the blood is running bright.</div>
<div class="i1">All nature knows our triumph, strange birds about us sweep,</div>

<div class="i1">Who’ve fought for him and conquered, who’ve won with sweat and gore</div>
<div class="i1">Nobility, which he shall have whene’er he touch the shore!</div>
<div class="i1">Oh, would I were an admiral, to order with a word&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">To lose a dozen drops of blood, and straight rise up a lord!</div>
<div class="i1">I’d shout to yon bold shark there, which follows in our lee,</div>
<div class="i1">“Some day I’ll make thee carry me like lightning through the sea!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Our admiral grew paler, and paler, as we flew,</div>
<div class="i1">Still talk’d he to the officers, and smiled upon the crew;</div>
<div class="i1">And he look’d up at the heavens, and he look’d down on the sea,</div>
<div class="i1">And at last he saw the creature that was following in our lee!</div>
<div class="i1">He shook&mdash;’twas but an instant: for speedily the pride</div>
<div class="i1">Ran crimson to his heart, till all chances he defied;</div>
<div class="i1">It threw boldness on his forehead, gave firmness to his breath,</div>

<div class="i1">That night a horrid whisper fell on us where we lay&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And we knew our fine old admiral was changing into clay</div>
<div class="i1">And we heard the wash of waters, though nothing could we see&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">A whistle and a plunge among the billows on our lee;</div>
<div class="i1">Till dawn we watched the body in its dead and ghastly sleep,</div>
<div class="i1">And next evening at sunset it was slung into the deep;</div>

<div class="i1">He shook&mdash;’twas but an instant&mdash;we saw his fearful plight,</div>
<div class="i1">The village clock struck eight just then; but that is never right.</div>
<div class="i1">He flogged the old grey horse along, till he was out of breath,</div>
<div class="i1">And when he reached the station doors he turned as pale as death.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">We heard a bell, and then a pause, and then a bell again!</div>
<div class="i1">We knew our fine old omnibus had missed the ‘eight up-train.’</div>
<div class="i1">And next we heard a rush of steam, but nothing could we see,</div>
<div class="i1">But a whistle and a puff among the fir-trees on our lee.</div>
<div class="i1">We watched the passing vapour till it vanished round the steep,</div>
<div class="i1">Then back again t’wards home with all our luggage did we creep;</div>
<div class="i1">But never from that moment, having once been ‘sold,’ again</div>
<div class="i1">We patronised the omnibus that always missed the train.</div>

<div class="i1">Our reading is all moonshine&mdash;the wind is not more free:</div>
<div class="i1">The champagne is all sparkling; we quaff it day and night,</div>
<div class="i1">Like creatures in whose sunny throats a thirsty flame burns bright.</div>
<div class="i1">All Oxford knows our triumph: fast birds around us sweep;</div>
<div class="i1">Strange “duns” come up to look at us, their masters though so deep;</div>
<div class="i1">In our wake, like any serpent, doth the night policeman go,</div>
<div class="i1">And at the toll-bar tarrieth the proctor with his pro.</div>
<div class="i1">Proud, proud must be each Brasenose man, at least so I should say,</div>
<div class="i1">Of all those grooms and flunkies who promptly him obey,</div>
<div class="i1">Who’ve ta’en his horse to covert, who’ve cleaned, with labour sore,</div>
<div class="i1">The snowy “tops” which he shall have when chapel-time is o’er.</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Who would not be a Brasenose man to order with a word,</div>
<div class="i1">His pink and well-built leathers, to turn out like a lord?</div>
<div class="i1">I’d shout to yonder hack there, though somewhat screwed it be&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Each morn I’ll make thee carry me Lord Redesdale’s hounds to see.</div>
<div class="i1">Each term our pace grew faster, and faster still it grew,</div>
<div class="i1">Yet talked we to our tradespeople, and gull them not a few;</div>
<div class="i1">And we looked into our bankers, but nothing could we see,</div>
<div class="i1">And at last there came the fearful time for what we call “degree.”</div>
<div class="i1">We read&mdash;’twas but an instant! for speedily the pride</div>
<div class="i1">Of being plucked twice for “little go,” all chance of ours defied;</div>
<div class="i1">This gave boldness to th’ examiners, as, sitting in a row,</div>
<div class="i1">They told us we might mizzle, for indeed it was no go.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">That night a horrid proctor fell on us where we lay,</div>
<div class="i1">And we knew some fine policemen were carrying us away;</div>
<div class="i1">And we heard the wash of waters&mdash;hard by the gutter we&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">And a whistle from a friend of ours who knew how it would be.</div>
<div class="i1">Till dawn they watched the body in its most unpleasant sleep,</div>
<div class="i1">And the two next Terms, at morning, they refused to let us keep;</div>
<div class="i1">And ever from that moment did one shudder for to see,</div>
<div class="i1">The proctor or policeman that had followed in our lee.</div>

<div class="i1">How merrily, how jollily we haste along the steep,</div>
<div class="i1">Though mist is all around us, and snow is lying deep;</div>
<div class="i1">The green Inn rushes foamingly, far down beneath our path,</div>
<div class="i1">And chafes against the stocks and stones, like an M.P. in wrath.</div>
<div class="i1">All nature holds a washing-day, with froth, and slop, and steam,</div>
<div class="i1">The wintry sun will scarcely deign vouchsafe one vagrant beam;</div>
<div class="i1">So when we reach Landek and stop, well may the <em>Gastwirth</em><span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_54" id="fnanchor_54"></a><a href="#footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></span> grin,</div>

<div class="i1">Oh! wet must be the Wanderer, for it has rained to-day,</div>
<div class="i1">Though he a red umbrella has, from Rome brought all the way.</div>
<div class="i1">The wind was high, the road was rough, where slushy mud snow,</div>
<div class="i1">Lay on the long and winding path, and through it went our Joe!</div>
<div class="i1">He sneezed! a moment’s weakness, for speedily he cried,</div>
<div class="i1">“Bring me a glass of your <em>Brantwein</em>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_56" id="fnanchor_56"></a><a href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></span> and a <em>masz</em> of Bier beside!”</div>
<div class="i1">It gave colour to his cheek and nose, yet took away his breath,</div>

<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>Chorus, discriminative and appreciatory</cite>:&mdash;)</div>
<div class="i1">Like some half-wash’d-out fox-hunter, that rides in at the death.</div>
<div class="poemdivider"><abbr title="Three">III.</abbr></div>
<div class="i1">The Wanderer grew merrier, and merrier still he grew,</div>
<div class="i1">Joining in all the harmless fun of that Tyrolean crew;</div>
<div class="i1">He sang Italian Opera airs, French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chansons</i>,<span class="lock"><a name="fnanchor_57" id="fnanchor_57"></a><a href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></span> English songs,</div>

<div class="i1">And fill’d it up: he took one sup, and then set-to at wine.</div>
<div class="i1">That night a horrid whisper pass’d, with calumny imbued,</div>
<div class="i1">It said “The long-hair’d Wanderer got regularly screw’d!”</div>
<div class="poemdivider">(<cite>Chorus, unanimous and valedictory.</cite>)</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">BEN JONSON’S “ODE ON THE STAGE.”</p>

<p>Ben Jonson was very unfortunate in not conciliating the
affections of his brother writers. He possessed a great share
of arrogance, and was desirous of ruling the realms of Parnassus
with a despotic sceptre. That he was not always
successful in his theatrical compositions is evident from his
abusing, on the title pages of his plays, both the actors and
the public. I have collected the following three satirical
odes, written when the unfavorable reception of his “<cite>New
Inn</cite>, or <cite>The Light Heart</cite>,” warmly exasperated the poet.</p>

<p>He printed the title in the following manner: “<cite>New Inn</cite>,
or <cite>The Light Heart</cite>; a Comedy never acted, but most
negligently played by some, the King’s servants; and more
squeamishly beheld and censured by others, the King’s subjects,
1629. Now at last set at liberty to the readers, his
Majesty’s servants and subjects, to be judged, 1631.”</p>

<p>At the end of this play he published the following Ode, in
which he threatens to quit the stage for ever; and turn at
once a Horace, an Anacreon, and a Pindar.</p>

<p>“The just indignation the author took at the vulgar censure
of his play, begat this following Ode to himself:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i3">Come, leave the loathed stage,</div>

<div class="i3">Usurp the chair of wit</div>
<div class="i1">Inditing and arraigning every day</div>
<div class="i3">Something they call a play.</div>
<div class="i2">Let their fastidious, vaine</div>

<p class="p2 center larger">HANG SORROW, LET’S CAST AWAY
CARE.</p>

<p>The <abbr title="Reverend">Rev.</abbr> Mr. J. W. Ebsworth, a great authority on our
early songs and ballads, supplies the following information
as to the different existing versions of “Hang sorrow.”</p>

<p>The music of this old ballad was composed by William
Lawes, and “published by John Hilton: printed for John
Benson and John Playford, and to be sould in <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan’s
Churchyard, and in the Inner Temple neare the
Church doore, 1652.” It reappeared in ‘Windsor Drollery,’
1672, with a few verbal alterations.</p>

<p>From J. Hilton’s ‘Catch that Catch Can,’ 1652 (music
by William Lawes):&mdash;</p>

<p>Another version appeared in an excessively rare work,
“The New Academy of Complements,” 1671, as, Song
276:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

<div class="i2">And the good old wife shall winde us,</div>

<p>A later version is in Playford’s ‘Musical Companion,’
1673. There is also a Roxburghe ballad beginning
similarly, but quite distinct from these two songs. It is
entitled, “Joy and Sorrow mixt together. To the tune
of, Such a Rogue should be hang’d.” Which is the same
tune as ‘Old Sir Simon the King.’ Here is the first of the
fourteen stanzas for comparison. The ballad is preserved
in the Roxburghe Collection (<abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 1. <abbr title="folio">fol.</abbr> 170), and has
been reprinted in the Ballad Society’s publication, <abbr title="volume">vol.</abbr> 1
p. 509:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">But ’tis a thumping sum per year most fervently we prize!</div>
<div class="i1">And so that we may get the more incessantly to waste,</div>
<div class="i1">Those blocks law students took of yore, we’re pulling down in haste;</div>

<div class="i1">Who duns attorneys when they shirk refreshers to renew&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">In short, does all the dirty work <em>we’d</em> rather die than do.</div>

<div class="i1">If any scandal should arise, quite safe is <em>our</em> fair fame;</div>

<div class="i1">“I am the cleverest of men! In all that I essay,</div>
<div class="i1">It is my rule on no account to second fiddle play.</div>
<div class="i1">There’s scarce a talent or a gift to which I lay not claim,</div>
<div class="i1">And “Chamberlain” has, thanks to me, become a famous name.</div>
<div class="i1">I brook no interference with the plans which I propose;</div>
<div class="i1">I’m dictatorial, to a fault, alike to friends and foes.</div>
<div class="i1">Nor am I satisfied applause for my own acts to win&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">No! I demand the self-same praise for all my kith and kin.</div>
<div class="i5">For we’re a clever family,</div>
<div class="i6">From Arthur down to Dick;</div>
<div class="i5">My Nephews, cousins, quite by dozens,</div>
<div class="i6">And brother-in-law Ken-<em>rick</em>.</div>

<div class="i1">“The nation must be daft to doubt a word of what I say,</div>
<div class="i1">Or think that Mr. Gladstone’s plan is equal to <em>my</em> way!</div>
<div class="i1">Poor man! What use is it for him his played-out brains to tax,</div>
<div class="i1">When all that Birmingham can give so notably he lacks?</div>
<div class="i1"><em>He</em> was not born there, has not been its Alderman or Mayor,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor tasted of those honours which our family still share.</div>
<div class="i1">O, foolish Gladstone! to suppose that any chance he runs</div>
<div class="i1">With me, the pride of Brummagem, and greatest of her sons!</div>
<div class="i5">And head of such a family, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And what can England be about to not at once agree</div>
<div class="i1">To simply leave her welfare to my family and me?</div>
<div class="i1">Why need she fear the rising storm will wreck or overwhelm?</div>
<div class="i1">Does she forget her Chamberlains have hurried to the helm?</div>
<div class="i1">Not Joseph only, for he’s called his brethren to his aid.</div>
<div class="i1">Oh! silly, silly England, to be, in spite of this, afraid!</div>
<div class="i1">For how can harm upon you come, or ill of any kind,</div>
<div class="i1">When, for your sake, the Chamberlains have openly combined?</div>

<div class="i1">If I withdraw the nerve and strength I gave it in the past?</div>
<div class="i1">Can they in sooth imagine that, however they may strive,</div>
<div class="i1">Their party possibly can hope my loss to long survive?</div>
<div class="i1">’Twould seem they can, and yet&mdash;no! no! it surely cannot be;</div>
<div class="i1">They <em>must</em> have learned the value of my family and me.</div>
<div class="i5">For we’re a clever family, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="i1">He still exists&mdash;such stubbornness is well-nigh past belief;</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve told him he must reckon with my family and me,</div>
<div class="i1">And yet he has not bowed as yet, not even on one knee.</div>
<div class="i1">I’ve warned him that he must my wrath most certainly expect,</div>
<div class="i1">And yet he positively dares to hold his head erect;</div>
<div class="i1">He must be mad, yes, very mad, to think that thus he can</div>
<div class="i1">Defy not me, the chief alone, but Caine and all my clan!</div>
<div class="i5">For we’re a clever family, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“And yet, as days and weeks go by, ’twould seem, I must confess,</div>
<div class="i1">That if my influence grows at all it only grows much less.</div>
<div class="i1">The Tories who two months ago knelt humbly at my feet,</div>
<div class="i1">Ignore the man who brought about the Government’s defeat;</div>
<div class="i1">The Whigs who warmly welcomed me as their most dear ally,</div>
<div class="i1">Already seem inclined to be reserved with me and shy.</div>
<div class="i1">In short, ’midst friends and foes alike a tendency I see</div>
<div class="i1">To underrate most shamefully my kith and kin and me.</div>
<div class="i5">Though we’re a clever family, &amp;c.</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“’Tis vain for me a caucus new to start, and it to man</div>
<div class="i1">With brothers and with relatives, all members of my clan,</div>
<div class="i1">If Radicals continue to ignore that caucus new,</div>
<div class="i1">And further dare my policy to laugh at and pooh-pooh;</div>
<div class="i1">In vain my family and I display our talents thus,</div>
<div class="i1">If the ungrateful State declares ’twill not be saved by us;</div>
<div class="i1">And ’tis in vain, too, that my foes I threaten and asperse,</div>
<div class="i1">When they are clearly for my threats in no wise aught the worse.</div>

<div class="i1">Can it, indeed, have come to pass that Birmingham’s chief pride</div>
<div class="i1">Is now a pow’rless leader who is feared by neither side?</div>
<div class="i1">Can it, indeed, be true that I, spite all my brethren’s aid,</div>

</div><span class="sc">The Three Jovial Statesmen.</span>

<p>Sir William Harcourt, at Glasgow, in quoting from <cite>The
Three Jovial Huntsmen</cite>, referred to it as “a delightful illustrated
story-book,” which he advised all his hearers to buy.
Quite so, Mr. Caldecott’s pictures are simply delicious, and
the verses themselves are quaint and pithy. But the “bearings
of ’em lie in their application.” And here’s their application&mdash;much
at your service, Sir William.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">It’s of Three Jovial Statesmen, and a-stumping they did go;</div>
<div class="i1">And they spouted and they flouted, and they blew their horns also.</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">And one said “Mind your eye, Staff, there’s Reaction in the wind,</div>
<div class="i1">And soon, by hook or crook, we a winning cry shall find.”</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They spouted and they flouted, and the first thing they did find,</div>
<div class="i1">Was a tattered scare-crow-mummy-thing, which seemed much to their mind.</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One said it <em>was</em> a scare-crow, but another he said “Nay;</div>
<div class="i1">It’s the real farmer’s friend, Fair Trade, and I think this cry will pay.”</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They spouted and they flouted, and the next thing they did find</div>
<div class="i1">Was a swelling, swaggering Bogey, its arms waving in the wind.</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One said it <em>was</em> a Bogey, but another he said, “Nay;</div>
<div class="i1">It’s our dear old Jingo-Fi-Fo-Fum, not yet quite past away.”</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They spouted and they flouted, and the next thing they did find</div>
<div class="i1">Was a Bull who browsed at leisure, and seemed easy in his mind.</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One said ’twas brave John Bull himself, another he said “Nay;</div>
<div class="i1">It’s just a Boer-whipt Jackass, without even pluck to bray.”</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They spouted and they flouted, and the next thing they did find</div>
<div class="i1">Was a fat pig grunting in a stye, with anger almost blind.</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One said it <em>was</em> a fat pig, but another he said “Nay;</div>
<div class="i1">It’s just a worthy Alderman who fears Reform’s black day.”</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">They spouted and they flouted, and the next thing they did find,</div>
<div class="i1">Was two old Patriots trying to bring Pat to his right mind.</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">One said they <em>were</em> two Patriots, but another he said, “Nay;</div>
<div class="i1">They’re just two ranting Demagogues. We’re sold! let’s come away.”</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">So they spouted and they flouted, till the setting of the sun;</div>
<div class="i1">And they hadn’t got a cry at last, when their stumping-course was run.</div>
<div class="i6">  Look ye there!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Then each unto the other said, “This stumping doesn’t pay;</div>
<div class="i1">But we’ve pounded up and down a bit, and had a rattling day.”</div>

<p>At that time there were loud complaints about the bad
ventilation of the House of Commons, and every remedy
tried, seemed only to make matters worse. Nor was much
improvement felt when the members were installed in Sir
Charles Barry’s new Palace of Westminster, which has
nearly every fault that it is possible a large public building
can have. The site is probably the worst that could

have been selected. The palace lies low, close to a polluted
river, which smells intolerably in the summer, and
gives off fog and damp in the winter. The style of architecture
is totally unsuited for our climate, or for the
purposes for which it is intended, and the stone of which it
is built is rapidly crumbling away, whilst although the
building covers nine acres of ground, the room in which
the Commons meet will only accommodate a little more
than half their number.</p>

<p>Every consideration of comfort and utility was sacrificed
to gratify an architectural fad, and the requirements of
the two legislative bodies who use the building were
simply ignored. Frequent debates have been held, and
divisions taken, to express the dissatisfaction of the members.
Committees have been appointed to examine into,
and report upon the heating and ventilation, the sanitary
arrangements, and the possibility of enlarging the Commons
chamber. Costly repairs are constantly going on,
crumbling stonework is removed and replaced, and experiments
of all kinds have been tried to remedy the
structural defects. But all to no purpose, and the building
remains a costly monument of a nation’s folly, and an
architect’s vanity and incompetence.</p>

<p>In August 1887, Mr. Plunket, questioned by Mr. Esslemont
and Dr. Kenny, said “he had no reason to believe that
the air of the House of Commons was noxious. As to the
artificial system of ventilation, it simply consisted in drawing
up the air through the ceiling when it had been breathed by
members, in order that there might be a freer and more constant
access of fresh air from below. That air passed over
ice to make it cooler, and he could not recommend the discontinuance
of the system. Straining the air through cotton
wool had been tried, but the officials were waiting for the
next fog before making another experiment.”</p>

<p>The late Mr. William Bates writing to <cite>Notes and

capital drinking song is a translation of one of the
<cite>Vaux-de-Vire</cite> of the fine old Norman Anacreon,
Olivier Basselin. W. H. Ainsworth puts the song
into the mouth of “Blueskin” in his novel <cite>Jack
Sheppard</cite>, but it was made famous by the late Paul
Bedford, who sang it in his celebrated impersonation
of “Blueskin” at the Adelphi Theatre,

<div class="i1">I’ll try a bottle of hair dye;</div>

<div class="i1">With a bottle labell’d black.</div>
<div class="i1">When I’d rubb’d it on my head,</div>
<div class="i1">I look’d beautiful, folks said,</div>
<div class="i1">But when I’d embraced dear Grace</div>

<p>In his day old Sir Peter Laurie was about as unpopular on
the Bench as Mr. Newton is in this, and was scarcely less
distinguished for the folly of his magisterial remarks. The
actual circumstance which gave rise to the parody occurred
in 1844, when a poor forlorn, half starved, and wholly ruined
young woman was charged before this great and good
Alderman.</p>

<p>“Sir Peter Laurie said he should send her to the Old
Bailey for attempted suicide. It was a fit case for trial, <em>and
he had no doubt she would be transported</em>. He had put an end
to persons attempting to drown themselves; he would now
try the same cure for attempted poisoning. He had no doubt
that those who took poison did not do so for the purpose of
self-destruction, but for the purpose of exciting sympathy.”</p>

<p>In October, 1866, a large number of English Volunteers
went to the <cite>Tir National</cite> in Brussels, and were received with
every mark of kindness and attention. The Belgians were
lavish in their hospitality, and on October 20, the King gave
a splendid dinner to all the English Volunteers then in
Brussels.</p>

<p>In 1867, about 2,000 members of the Belgian Garde
Civique paid a return visit, and were most cordially received
by the London Volunteers. A great deal of money was
spent in entertaining them, but the general arrangements
were faulty in the extreme, and Royal hospitality was conspicuously
absent.</p>

<p>From <cite>Songs of the Edinburgh Troop</cite>. July, 1820.
Edinburgh: James Ballantyne &amp; Company. 1825.</p>

<p>A curious, and now very scarce little collection of songs
relating to the Edinburgh Yeomanry Cavalry, which was
privately printed, and afterwards suppressed. There were
nine songs in all, of which this was the first, dating from
July 1820 to July 1823; they were written jointly by John
Gibson Lockhart and Patrick F. Tytler, author of <cite>The
History of Scotland</cite>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the article on Lockhart in <cite>The Maclise Portrait Gallery</cite>
Mr. W. Bates mentions the <cite>brochure</cite> as being very scarce.
The above song has been kindly sent by Mr. James Gordon,
F.S.A., Scotland.</p>

<p class="center">&mdash;&mdash;<i>:o:</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A prize parody competition on Campbell’s song took place
in <cite>Truth</cite>, and fifteen versions were printed on July 1, 1886.
Of these the first verses of a few may be quoted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="i1">The hours while she number’d, her anger still slumber’d,</div>

<p>In July, 1859, the Emperor Napoleon <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> concluded a
sudden and unexpected armistice with Austria, just at a time
when all the world was expecting to see Italy freed from
the hated rule of the Hapsburgs, and the Bourbons. Count
Cavour resigned his ministerial posts, the indignation of
the Italians was unbounded, and revolutions broke out all
over the Peninsula.</p>

<div class="i1">You all knew Pat Fagan, the labourer, well;</div>
<div class="i1">The bell just done tolling, was poor Paddy’s knell:</div>
<div class="i1">A more able hodsman can never be found,</div>
<div class="i1"><abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Giles’s well known to him every inch round.</div>
<div class="i1">No pal that e’er cross’d him, whether little or big,</div>
<div class="i1">But he’d challenge the boy, and flourish his sprig;</div>
<div class="i1">And all with attention would eagerly fix,</div>
<div class="i1">When they cheered up the boy with, “Paddy, more bricks!</div>
<div class="i5">A little water!&mdash;more mortar!</div>
<div class="i6">Below, Pat, below!”</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Six whacking big chairmen, with togs queerly dress’d,</div>
<div class="i1">Supported poor Pat to his last place of rest;</div>
<div class="i1">His hod, which he styled the best hod in the world,</div>
<div class="i1">(On whose top hung his jacket, like a flag that’s unfurled,)</div>
<div class="i1">His cap, boots, and shovel, in a trophy was bound,</div>
<div class="i1">And the spalpeens all join’d in the “hubbaboo” sound;</div>
<div class="i1">But no more, sure, the boys his loud “hollo” will fix,</div>
<div class="i1">Nor the buildings resound with, “Paddy, more bricks!</div>
<div class="i5">A little water!&mdash;more mortar!</div>
<div class="i6">Hollo, Pat, hollo!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">Thus Pat spoke, “My honies, now I give up de ghost,</div>
<div class="i1">I hope of my death you’ll all make de most;</div>
<div class="i1">One favour I’ll ask&mdash;the same I will crave&mdash;</div>
<div class="i1">Kick a thundering big row up, now, over my grave;</div>
<div class="i1">And, unless I jump up and flourish my sprig,</div>
<div class="i1">My boys, you’ll conclude I’m as dead as a pig!”</div>
<div class="i1">Honest Pat was obey’d&mdash;the howls rent the sky,</div>
<div class="i1">And the spalpeens all join’d in the “hubbaboo” cry.</div>
<div class="i5">“Hubbaboo!&mdash;philliloo!</div>
<div class="i4">Arrah, my darling, why did you die?</div>
<div class="i5">Och, murder!&mdash;Pat, come back!”</div>

<p>There are many other versions of this song. It has
always been a favourite with the Irish people at all times
of political excitement; either varied or re-written, according

to circumstances. At the time of the celebrated Clare
election, carried by Daniel O’Connell while the “Catholic
Emancipation” cause was yet pending, they sang a street
ballad in Dublin running thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

Cunning arrangements of black curtains, grinning skeletons,

<div class="i1">O Mary, I believed you true,</div>

<div class="i1">But then to gaze on that fair face&mdash;</div>
<div class="i2">It would have been an unfair feeling</div>

<div class="i1">Who could have thought you, Mary Jones,</div>
<div class="i2">Among the Joans that link with <em>Darbies</em>!</div>
</div><div class="stanza">

<div class="i2">My goods were yours, if I had got any,</div>

<p>The <cite>New Whig Guide</cite> (London: W. Wright. 1819), contains
several parodies of the songs of Thomas Moore and of
Lord Byron, but being all on political topics they are now
out of date, almost unintelligible, and not generally interesting.
They are styled <cite>English Melodies</cite>, the first lines are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">“Oh! the time is past when quarter-day my cares would chase.” <br />
(Moore’s <cite>Love’s Young Dream</cite>.)</p>

<p class="center">“Old Tierney came down like a wolf on the fold.” <br />
(Byron’s <cite>Destruction of Sennacherib</cite>.)</p>

<p class="center">“Believe me, when all those ridiculous airs.” <br />
(Moore’s <cite>Believe me, if all those endearing young charms</cite>.)</p>

<p class="center">“Son of the faithless! melancholy rat!” <br />
(Byron’s <cite>Sun of the Sleepless</cite>)</p>

<p class="center">“Fare ye well&mdash;and if for Easter.” <br />
(Byron’s <cite>Fare you well&mdash;and if for ever</cite>.)</p>

<p>In the early days of the century Moore and Byron were
the Society poets, their verses were on everyone’s lips, and
naturally parodies of them abounded. In addition to the
translations of Moore’s melodies already given, several other
Greek, Latin, and French versions will be found in the collected
works of Francis S. Mahony.</p>

<p>Taffy is a corruption of Taffid, the Welsh form of David.
This very old nursery rhyme owes its origin to the continual
raids and cattle-lifting expeditions which took place on the
Welsh borders in the middle ages, but it has long since lost
all serious meaning with those who repeat it. Twenty years
ago the late Mr. Shirley Brooks completely re-modelled the
poem very much in Taffy’s favour.</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">Taffy is a Welshman:</div>
<div class="i2">Taffy’s not a thief;</div>
<div class="i1">Taffy’s mutton’s very good,</div>
<div class="i2">Not so good his beef:</div>
<div class="i1">I went to Taffy’s house,</div>
<div class="i2">Several things I saw,</div>
<div class="i1">Cleanliness and godliness,</div>
<div class="i2">Obedience to the law.</div>
<div class="i1">If Taffy rides to my house,</div>
<div class="i2">Or unto Pat’s doth swim,</div>
<div class="i1">I think my Taffy will remark</div>
<div class="i2">That we might learn of him.</div>
<div class="i1">He does not drink, my Taffy,</div>
<div class="i2">(Not leastwise as a rule);</div>
<div class="i1">He goes to chapel regular,</div>
<div class="i2">And sends his boys to school;</div>
<div class="i1">He dresses well on Sunday,</div>
<div class="i2">His family the like;</div>
<div class="i1">He’s not too fond of over-work,</div>
<div class="i2">But seldom cares to strike;</div>
<div class="i1">He never lurks behind a hedge</div>
<div class="i2">To pay his rent with slugs.</div>
<div class="i1">Up craggy hills of steep incline</div>
<div class="i2">His garden mould he lugs;</div>
<div class="i1">And there he grows his garden,</div>
<div class="i2">His cabbages and leeks;</div>
<div class="i1">His kids get green meat in their mouths,</div>
<div class="i2">And roses in their cheeks.</div>
<div class="i1">Taffy is a Welshman,</div>
<div class="i2">And glories in the name,</div>
<div class="i1">To laugh at which enjoyment</div>
<div class="i2">Appears to me a shame.</div>
<div class="i1">You compliment the Scotchman</div>
<div class="i2">Who talks of Bruce and Burns;</div>
<div class="i1">You tolerate the Irishman</div>
<div class="i2">Who vaunts ancestral Kerns;</div>
<div class="i1">You’re nuts on your own pedigree,</div>
<div class="i2">Won’t call it English, fair,</div>
<div class="i1">But prate of “Anglo-Saxons,”</div>
<div class="i2">Till Reviewers nearly swear.</div>
<div class="i1">Why shouldn’t gallant Taffy</div>
<div class="i2">Have his relics and his bones,</div>
<div class="i1">Llewelyns and Cadwallos,</div>
<div class="i2">And Griffyevanjones?</div>
<div class="i1">To say nothing of the question</div>
<div class="i2">Whether Taffy’s mother-tongue</div>
<div class="i1">Wasn’t quite a fine old</div>
<a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a><span class="pageno">256</span>
<div class="i2">When all of ours were young.</div>
<div class="i1">He says he has good poets,</div>
<div class="i2">Leave him his own opinion:</div>
<div class="i1">You like obscure old ballads,</div>
<div class="i2">And Taffy likes Englynion.</div>
<div class="i1">Pray are not “moel,” “afon,”</div>
<div class="i2">And “Morwyns” (pretty rogues),</div>
<div class="i1">At least as good as “birks” and “braes,”</div>
<div class="i2">“Mavourneens,” “Arrah Pogues!”</div>
<div class="i1">By all Nantfrancon’s Beavers,</div>
<div class="i2">Of the pre-historic age;</div>
<div class="i1">By Aberglaslyn’s hoary bridge,</div>
<div class="i2">And the Swallow’s roaring rage;</div>
<div class="i1">By the trout of Capel Curig,</div>
<div class="i2">By Carnarvon’s Eagled Tower,</div>
<div class="i1">The smile of placid Tan-y-bwlch,</div>
<div class="i2">And the frown of Penmaenmawr;</div>
<div class="i1">By yon lonely Puffin Island,</div>
<div class="i2">And the monster head of Orme,</div>
<div class="i1">The Castle of the Beauteous Marsh,</div>
<div class="i2">Llanberis, Pass of Storm;</div>
<div class="i1">By the magic bridge of Bangor,</div>
<div class="i2">Hung awful in the sky,</div>
<div class="i1">By the grave at sweet Beddgelert,</div>
<div class="i2">Where the Martyr-hound doth lie;</div>
<div class="i1">By the lightnings that on Snowdon</div>
<div class="i2">Glint, the jewels of his crown,</div>
<div class="i1">Stand up, brave Taffy, for thy right,</div>
<div class="i2">And never be put down.</div>
<div class="i1">If all Victoria’s subjects</div>
<div class="i2">Were half as good as thou,</div>
<div class="i1">Victoria’s subjects would kick up</div>
<div class="i2">Uncommon little row.</div>
<div class="i1">And <cite>Punch</cite>, Incarnate Justice,</div>
<div class="i2">Intends henceforth to lick</div>
<div class="i1">All who shall scorn or sneer at you,</div>

<div class="i1">That silky mane I braided once, must be another’s care.</div>
<div class="i1">The morning sun shall dawn again&mdash;but never more with thee</div>
<div class="i1">Shall I gallop o’er the desert paths where we were wont to be&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">Thy bright form for a moment, like the false mirage, appears?</div>
<div class="i1">Slow and unmounted will I roam, with wearied foot alone,</div>
<div class="i1">Where, with fleet step, and joyous bound, thou oft hast borne me on;</div>
<div class="i1">And sitting down by the green well, I’ll pause, and sadly think,&mdash;</div>

<div class="i1">They tempted me, my beautiful! but I have loved too long.</div>
<div class="i1">Who said that I had given thee up? Who said that thou wert sold?</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis false! ’tis false! my Arab steed! I fling them back their gold!</div>

<div class="i1">Thy bright light for a moment like a Will-o’-the-wisp appears,</div>
<div class="i1">By parliamentary slow, alas, I now must travel on</div>
<div class="i1">Where with thy speed and joyous shriek rejoiced I should have gone;</div>
<div class="i1">But, sitting down on yon platform, I now in vain must grunt,</div>
<div class="i1">“It was here he blew his whistle shrill, when last I saw him shunt!”</div>
</div><div class="stanza">
<div class="i1">“When last I saw him shunt!” Away! The foolish dream is o’er;</div>
<div class="i1">I see that thou art shunting still, and here thou art once more.</div>
<div class="i1">They tempted me, my railway train, for hunger’s power is strong;</div>
<div class="i1">They tempted me, my railway train! I near had gorged too long!</div>
<div class="i1">Who said that I had lost the train? Who said that thou wast gone?</div>
<div class="i1">’Tis false&mdash;’tis false, my railway train; I still shall travel on.</div>

<p>During the Presidential Campaign of 1884 in the United
States of America a great deal of jealousy and strife existed
between different cities on the question as to where the
nominating conventions should be held. After the Convention
for the Republican party had been located at Chicago,
the struggle became still more fierce as to where the Democratic
Convention should assemble. It was Chicago against
the field, but <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis a long way ahead of all other competitors.
Both cities had committees working in Washington
to support their interests, but finally the location was awarded
to Chicago, whereupon the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis people were in great
wrath and indignation, and the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis newspapers were
very bitter in their remarks upon the contest.</p>

<p>Chicago, content with its victory, could afford to laugh at
 <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Louis, and the following parody appeared in the “<cite>Chicago
Tribune</cite>”&mdash;</p>

<div class="i2">Says Freedom, “Why, that’s my own Island!”</div>

<div class="i4">O, what a snug little Island!</div>
<div class="i5">They’d all have a touch at the Island!</div>

<div class="i1">Since Freedom and Neptune have hitherto kept tune,</div>

“The Cannibal Islands,” “The Ratcatcher’s Daughter,”
“I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls,” and many other

<p><cite>The Mélange</cite>, published in Liverpool in 1834. contained a
number of songs of “High Tory and No Popery” sentiments,
such as “Up, Protestants, Up!” in which the Pope
and the Devil were ranged side by side, and a parody entitled
“<cite>Rouse, Britons! Arouse</cite>.” Also the following verses to

<p>This was evidently written before the death of George <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
in 1830; he was succeeded by William, the <em>Clarence</em> alluded to
in the song. King William was suspected of having Liberal
leanings, and an Orange plot existed to displace him and put
his brother Ernest, Duke of Cumberland, on the throne,
thus entirely excluding the Princess Victoria from the succession.
This plot was exposed by Joseph Hume; but it
never had any chance of success, for the Duke of Cumberland,
profligate, brutal, and overbearing, was thoroughly
hated by the English people. On the death of William <abbr title="Four">IV.</abbr>
Cumberland became King of Hanover, and this country was
finally relieved of his presence, and his plots. In the time
of the Georges the following additional verse was sometimes
sung:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="i1">God save great George our King,</div>
<div class="i1">Long live our noble King,</div>
<div class="i3">God save the King.</div>

<cite>Ancient Druid</cite>), of Lodge 91. Adapted to popular and
well-known tunes.” George Elliott, Blackfriars Road.
London, 1839.&mdash;This pamphlet of 48 pages contains a
number of songs in praise of the Ancient Order of Druids,
to be sung to once popular airs, the majority of which are
now quite forgotten. They are not actual Parodies.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Corn Law Rhymes</span>, and other Poems” by Ebenezer
Elliott, London. B. Steill, 1844, contained parodies of
“Robin Adair,” “Scots wha hae,” “Rule Britannia,”
&amp;c., all relating to the scarcity of food, and the protective
duties.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Songs of the Press</span>, <cite>and other Poems</cite>,” original and
selected, by C. H. Timperley. London. Fisher, Son
and Co. 1845.&mdash;This amusing work contains a number of
songs adapted to popular airs; they are very technical in
their language, and only those already quoted can be styled
Parodies.</p>

<p>“<span class="sc">Motley</span>,” by Cuthbert Bede, B.A., published in 1855 by
James Blackwood, London, contained a number of imitations
of the popular songs of the day. Most of them related
to incidents in the Crimean War.</p>

<p>Professor Browne, of Fenchurch Street, London,
hair-dresser and wig maker, has for more than twenty-five
years issued small almanacs to his customers. These have
contained a number of curious parodies relating to the Professor’s
business, and praising his skill and enterprise. In
some cases the humour of these productions was very quaint
and grotesque.</p>

<p>Numerous short parodies of popular songs are to be
found in the theatrical burlesques and extravaganzas produced
during the last fifty years. As a rule they consist
of a few couplets only, and possess no interest apart from
their context. Hundreds of these ephemeral <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeux d’esprit</i>
have been produced, and the following are the names of
the most prolific authors of dramatic burlesques:&mdash;Vincent

<p>A more detailed account of dramatic burlesques will be
given in a future volume.</p>

<p>Amongst collections of songs written for societies, such
as the Freemasons, Druids, Anglers, Cricket and Football
Clubs, Conservative, Liberal, and Radical Associations,
many are to be found written to the airs of popular songs.
As a rule these are not parodies.</p>

<p>There are numerous advertisement parodies of songs,
some of considerable merit; the best of these have been
quoted.</p>

<p>Some purely unintentional travesties of songs are really
the most laughable and amusing, as, for instance, the
absurd translations given in the English libretti of the
Italian operas. Those who can appreciate comic songs
should certainly also read Messrs. Augner’s edition of
Schubert’s songs with English and German words. The
song “Alinde” commences thus in the English version:
“The sun sinks down into the meer, forth hast she not
ridden?” This is intended to be a translation of “Die
Sonne sinkt in’s tiefe meer, da wollte sie nicht kommen.”
What is a meer? In several other cases the German word
meer (sea) is translated meer. As a second example
take “<cite>The Fisher</cite>.” “The water rushed, the water
swelled, A fisher there bestow’d, With lazy angle, felt the
hush, His heart with coolness load!” How could any
man with his wits about him write such arrant nonsense?
It certainly seems like an attempt to translate literally,
but in the “Nachtstück” (night piece) an unpardonable
deviation is made from the original. “Luna mit gewölken
kämpft” we are told means “Luna camped upon
the clouds!” Last, but not least, in that exquisite little
song “Der Tod und das Mädchen,” which is unpoetically
called “Death and the Girl,” the German runs thus:
“Vor über ach vor über, geh wilder knochenmann.”
Surely the translator struck the summit of absurdity in
rendering it, “Pass onward, pass onward, wild man with
skinless bone!” It is not a matter for surprise that we
seldom hear any of Schubert’s works, except perhaps
“Ave Maria,” in an English drawing-room, when the
translations offered are hardly fit for nigger minstrels.
There is much room for improvement in the poetry of our
modern popular sentimental songs, whether intended for
the stage, or the concert room. Yet ridiculous as these often
are, they do not approach the nonsense, called translations
from Italian, French, or German songs, where the effort
required to render the sense in a metre suitable to the
melody seems too much for any ordinary translator to
cope with.</p>

<p class="p2 center larger">MORE ABOUT LORD TENNYSON’S
JUBILEE ODE.</p>

<p>Several parodies of this Ode were given in Part 43
(June) but since then some others have appeared.</p>

<p>The universal opinion that Tennyson’s poem was a
failure, and altogether unworthy of his reputation has
been expressed in several ways, one London evening
paper printed a couple of the Laureate’s verses “as they
ought to be” thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>“You then loyally, all of you, deck your houses, illuminate
all your towns for a festival, and in each let a multitude
loyal, each, to the heart of it one full voice of
allegiance, hail the great Ceremonial of this year of her
Jubilee.”</p>

<p>“You, the Patriot Architect, shape a stately memorial,
make it regally gorgeous, some Imperial Institute, rich in
symbol, in ornament, which may speak to the centuries,
all the centuries after us, of this year of her Jubilee.”</p>

<p>Instead of being poetry of transcendent merit, it
seems to be a poor imitation of the language of Scripture.
Others declare it to be an imitation of the style of
<span class="sc">Walt Whitman</span>, and the Ode has even been compared
to a badly-written catalogue! One satirist went so far as
to plead in the Laureate’s latest style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container">

 These ancient political prophecies are amusing reading,
but require some little explanation. In July, 1849, Baron
Lionel de Rothschild was elected M.P. for the City of
London, with 6,619 votes, whilst his opponent, Lord John
Manners, only polled 3,104. But Baron Rothschild was not
then allowed to take his seat, nor was it until he had been
thrice again elected M.P. that he was permitted to enter
the House of Commons in July, 1858. Shortly afterwards a
special act was passed permitting Jewish M.P.’s to omit
from the oath the words, “on the faith of a Christian;”
since then many eminent Jews have been elected to the
House of Commons, where they have generally supported
the party which formerly opposed, to the very utmost, the
extension to them of civil rights and political equality.</p>

 This song was introduced into Davenant’s comedy of <cite>The Rivals</cite>,
1668; but is probably still older. The phrase to “marry with a rush
ring,” is introduced in the ancient ballad of “The Winchester

 This clever parody has reference to the attempt made by
the Duke of Northumberland to evade the payment of Mr.
Pitt’s Income-tax. To mitigate the severity of the pressure
on persons with large families, a deduction of ten per cent.
was allowed to persons who had above a certain number of
children. Amongst others the wealthy Duke of Northumberland
was not ashamed to avail himself of this clause.</p>

 Sir Hugh Smithson married the Lady Elizabeth, daughter
and only child of the Duke of Northumberland, who died in
1750. In the same year he obtained an Act of Parliament,
authorizing him to assume the surname and arms of Percy.
In 1767 the King created him Earl Percy and Duke of
Northumberland. The hero of this ballad was the eldest son
of this marriage.</p>

not certainly from any want of reverence, but rather out of the
fulness of our admiration, just as the excess of a lover’s fondness
often runs over into raillery of the very qualities that are dearest
to his heart. ‘Let no one,’ says Heine, ‘ridicule mankind unless
he loves them.’ With no less truth may it be said, Let no one
parody a poet unless he loves him. He must first be penetrated
by his spirit, and have steeped his ear in the music of his verse,
before he can reflect these under a humorous aspect with success.</cite>”</p>

<h4 class="h4head">Transcriber’s Note:</h4>

<p>This book was written in a period when many words had not become
standardized in their spelling. Words may have multiple spelling
variations or inconsistent hyphenation in the text. These have been
left unchanged except indicated below.</p>

<p>Footnotes were renumbered sequentially and were moved to the
end of the book. Obvious printing errors, such as backwards, upside
down, or partially printed letters and punctuation, were corrected.
Unprinted letters, punctuation and final stops missing at the end of sentences
and abbreviations were added. Commas were changed to stops at ends of
sentences and abbreviations. Duplicate words and letters at line
endings and page breaks were removed. Quotation marks were adjusted to
match as pairs.</p>

<p>In the Table of Contents, Part 24 was moved from Volume <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> to Volume <abbr title="Two">II.</abbr>
Where there was a difference in punctuation, accents, hyphenation,
etc. between the index entry and the poem text, the index entry was
adjusted to match that of the poem. Unprinted page numbers were added to the index.</p>

<p>There are three anchors to Footnote <a href="#footnote_5">[5]</a>,
two anchors to Footnote <a href="#footnote_8">[8]</a>, and
two anchors to Footnote <a href="#footnote_49">[49]</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#c10">A TALE OF THE TENTH HUSSARS</a> and its parody were printed on facing
pages across a page break. The end of each poem was rejoined to
its beginning.  Likewise, Swinburne's <a href="#question">The Question</a> and <a href="#answer">The Answer</a> were printed on facing columns across several pages.
Each poem was presented in its entirety followed by its parody.</p>

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
